" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ganglion of the left wrist. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ganglion of the left wrist. OPERATION: Excision of ganglion. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. OPERATION: After a successful anesthetic, the patient was positioned on the operating table. A tourniquet applied to the upper arm. The extremity was prepped in a usual manner for a surgical procedure and draped off. The superficial vessels were exsanguinated with an elastic wrap and the tourniquet was then inflated to the usual arm pressure. A curved incision was made over the presenting ganglion over the dorsal aspect of the wrist. By blunt and sharp dissection, it was dissected out from underneath the extensor tendons and the stalk appeared to arise from the distal radiocapitellar joint and the dorsal capsule was excised along with the ganglion and the specimen was removed and submitted. The small superficial vessels were electrocoagulated and instilled after closing the skin with 4-0 Prolene, into the area was approximately 6 to 7 mL of 0.25 Marcaine with epinephrine. A Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted and then after the tourniquet was released, it was kept deflated until at least 5 to 10 minutes had passed and then it was activated and then removed in the recovery room. The dressings applied to the hand were that of Xeroform, 4x4s, ABD, Kerlix, and elastic wrap over a volar fiberglass splint. The tourniquet was released. Circulation returned to the fingers. The patient then was allowed to awaken and left the operating room in good condition.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cervical myelopathy, C3-4, secondary to stenosis from herniated nucleus pulposus, C3-4. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical myelopathy, C3-4, secondary to stenosis from herniated nucleus pulposus, C3-4. OPERATIVE PROCEDURES 1. Anterior cervical discectomy with decompression, C3-4. 2. Arthrodesis with anterior interbody fusion, C3-4. 3. Spinal instrumentation using Pioneer 18-mm plate and four 14 x 4.3 mm screws (all titanium). 4. Implant using PEEK 7 mm. 5. Allograft using Vitoss. DRAINS: Round French 10 JP drain. FLUIDS: 1800 mL of crystalloids. URINE OUTPUT: 1000 mL. SPECIMENS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL. CONDITION: To postanesthesia care unit extubated with stable vital signs. INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION: This is a case of a very pleasant 32-year-old Caucasian male who had been experiencing posterior neck discomfort and was shooting basketball last week, during which time he felt a pop. Since then, the patient started complaining of acute right arm and right leg weakness, which had been progressively worsening. About two days ago, he started noticing weakness on the left arm. The patient also noted shuffling gait. The patient presented to a family physician and was referred to Dr. X for further evaluation. Dr. X could not attempt to this, so he called me at the office and the patient was sent to the emergency room, where an MRI of the brain was essentially unremarkable as well as MRI of the thoracic spine. MRI of the cervical spine, however, revealed an acute disk herniation at C3-C4 with evidence of stenosis and cord changes. Based on these findings, I recommended decompression. The patient was started on Decadron at 10 mg IV q.6h. Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him. Risks to include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection. Bleeding can be superficial, but can compromise airway, for which he has been told that he may be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma. The hematoma could also be an epidural hematoma, which may compress the spinal cord and result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function. Should this happen, he needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma. There is also the risk by removing the hematoma that he can deteriorate as far as neurological condition, but this hopefully with the steroid prep will be prevented or if present will only be transient. There is also the possibility of infection, which can be superficial and treated with IV and p.o. antibiotics. However, should the infection be extensive or be deep, he may require return to the operating room for debridement and irrigation. This may pose a medical problem since in the presence of infection, the graft as well as spinal instrumentation may have to be removed. There is also the possibility of dural tear with its attendant complaints of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, as well as the development of pseudomeningocele. This too can compromise airway and may require return to the operating room for repair of the dural tear. There is also potential risk of injury to the esophagus, the trachea, as well as the carotid. The patient can also have a stroke on the right cerebral circulation should the plaque be propelled into the right circulation. The patient understood all these risks together with the risk associated with anesthesia and agreed to have the procedure performed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress. After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted. No monitoring leads were placed. The patient was then positioned supine on the operating table with the head supported on a foam doughnut and the neck placed on hyperextension with a shoulder roll under both shoulders. Localizing x-ray verified the marker to be right at the C3-4 interspace. Proceeded to mark an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid with the central point at the area of the marker measuring about 3 cm in length. The area was then prepped with DuraPrep. After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10. Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to cut the platysma in a similar fashion. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried superior to and lateral to the esophagus and trachea, but medial to the carotid sheath. The prevertebral fascia was identified. Localizing x-ray verified another marker to be at the C3-4 interspace. Proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C3 and C4 and a self-retaining retractor was then laid out. There was some degree of anterior osteophyte and this was carefully drilled down with a Midas 5-mm bur. The disk was then cut through the annulus and removal of the disk was done with the use of the Midas 5-mm bur and later a 3-mm bur. The inferior endplate of C3 and the superior endplate of C4 were likewise drilled out together with posterior inferior osteophyte at the C3 and the posterior superior osteophyte at C4. There was note of a central disk herniation centrally, but more marked displacement of the cord on the left side. By careful dissection of this disk, posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and pressure on the cord was removed. Hemostasis of the epidural bleeders was done with a combination of bipolar coagulation, but we needed to put a small piece of Gelfoam on the patient's left because of profuse venous bleeder. With this completed, the Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage. A 7-mm implant with its interior packed with Vitoss was then tapped into place. An 18-mm plate was then screwed down with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws. The area was irrigated with saline, with bacitracin solution. Postoperative x-ray showed excellent placement of the graft and spinal instrumentation. A round French 10 JP drain was laid over the construct and exteriorized though a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly. The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis and Dermabond. The catheter was anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch. Dressing was placed only on the exit site of the drain. C-collar was placed, and the patient was transferred to the recovery awake and moving all four extremities.",TRUE
" HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old female being seen today for evaluation of pain and symptoms related to a recurrent bunion deformity in bilateral feet, right greater than left. The patient states she is having increasing symptoms of pain and discomfort associated with recurrence of bunion deformity on the right foot and pain localized to the second toe and MTP joint of the right foot as well. The patient had prior surgery performed approximately 13 years ago. She states that since the time of the original surgery the deformity has slowly recurred, and she has noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes at the second and third toes of the left foot and involving the second toe of the right foot. The patient is employed on her feet as a hospital employee and states that she does wear a functional orthotic which does provide some relief of forefoot pain although not complete. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY & REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: See Patient History sheet, which was reviewed with the patient and is signed in the chart. Past medical history on the patient, past surgical history, current medications, drug-related allergies and social history have all been updated and reviewed, and enclosed in the chart. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical exam reveals a pleasant, 57-year-old female who is 5 feet 4 inches and 150 pounds. She has palpable pulses. Neurologic sensation is intact. Examination of the extremities shows the patient as having well-healed surgical sites from her arthroplasty, second digits bilaterally and prior bunionectomy. There is a recurrence of bunion deformity noted on both great toes although the patient notes to have reasonably good range of movement. She has particular pain in the second MTP joint of the right foot and demonstrates a mild claw-toe deformity of the second and third toes to the left foot, and to a lesser degree the second toe to the right. Gait analysis: The patient stands and walks with a rather severe pes planus and has generalized hypermobility noted in the feet. X-RAY INTERPRETATION: X-rays taken today; three views to the right foot shows presence of internal K-wire and wire from prior bunionectomy. Biomechanical analysis shows 15 degree intermetatarsal angle and approximately 45 degree hallux abducto valgus angle. No evidence of arthrosis in the joint is noted. Significant shift to the fibular sesamoid is present. ASSESSMENT: 1. Recurrent bunion deformity, right forefoot. 2. Pes planovalgus deformity, bilateral feet. PLAN/TREATMENT: 1. Today, we did review remaining treatment options with the patient including the feasibility of conservative versus surgical treatment. The patient would require an open wedge osteotomy to reduce the intermetatarsal angle with the lateral release and a decompression osteotomy at the second metatarsal. Anticipated length of healing was noted for the patient as were potential risks and complications. The patient ultimately would probably require surgery on her left foot at a later date as well. 2. The patient will explore her ability to get out of work for the above-mentioned period of time and will be in touch with regards regarding scheduling at a later date. 3. All questions were answered.",FALSE
" CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased ability to perform daily living activities secondary to right knee surgery. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old white female status post right total knee replacement secondary to degenerative joint disease performed by Dr. A at ABCD Hospital on 08/21/2007. The patient was transfused with 2 units of autologous blood postoperatively. She received DVT prophylaxis with a combination of Coumadin, Lovenox, SCD boots, and TED stockings. The remainder of her postoperative course was uneventful. She was discharged on 08/24/2007 from ABCD Hospital and admitted to the transitional care unit at XYZ Services for evaluation and rehabilitation. The patient reports that her last bowel movement was on 08/24/2007 just prior to her discharge from ABCD Hospital. She denies any urological symptoms such as dysuria, incomplete bladder emptying or other voiding difficulties. She reports having some right knee pain, which is most intense at a &quot;certain position.&quot; The patient is unable to elaborate on which &quot;certain position&quot; causes her the most discomfort. ALLERGIES: NKDA. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hypothyroidism, degenerative joint disease, GERD, anxiety disorder, Morton neuroma of her feet bilaterally, and distant history of migraine headaches some 30 years ago. MEDICATIONS: On transfer, Celebrex, Coumadin, Colace, Synthroid, Lovenox, Percocet, Toprol XL, niacin, and trazodone. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96.5, blood pressure 127/72, pulse 70, respiratory rate 20, 95% O2 saturation on room air. GENERAL: No acute distress at the time of the exam except as mentioned above complains of right knee pain at &quot;certain position.&quot; HEENT: Normocephalic. Sclerae nonicteric. EOMI. Dentition in good repair. Tongue is in midline with no evidence of thrush. NECK: No thyroid enlargement. Trachea is midline. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. No organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: The right knee incision is intact. Steri-Strips are in place. There is some diffuse right knee edema and some limited ecchymosis as well. No calf tenderness bilaterally. Pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. MENTAL STATUS: The patient appears slightly anxious during the interview and exam, but she was alert and oriented. HOSPITAL COURSE: As mentioned above, the patient was admitted on 08/24/2007 to the Transitional Care Unit at XYZ Services for evaluation and rehabilitation. She was seen in consultation by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and had begun her rehabilitation till recovery. The patient had been properly instructed regarding using the CPM machine and she had been instructed as well to limit each CPM session to two hours. Very early in her hospitalization, the patient enthusiastically used the CPM much longer than two hours and consequently had increased right knee pain. She remarked that she had a better degree of flexibility, but she did report an increased need for pain management. Additionally, she required Ativan and at one point scheduled the doses of Ativan to treat her known history of anxiety disorder. On the fourth hospital day, she was noted to have some rashes about the right upper extremity and right side of her abdomen. The patient reported that this rash was itchy. She reports that she had been doing quite a bit of gardening just prior to surgery and this was most likely contact dermatitis, most likely due to her gardening activities preoperatively. She was treated with betamethasone cream applied to the rash b.i.d. The patient's therapy had progressed and she continued to make a good progress. At one point, the patient reported some insomnia due to right knee pain. She was switched from Percocet to oxycodone SR 20 mg b.i.d. and she had good pain control with this using the Percocet only for breakthrough pain. The DVT prophylaxis was maintained with Lovenox 40 mg subcu daily until the INR was greater than 1.7 and it was discontinued on 08/30/2007 when the INR was 1.92 within therapeutic range. The Coumadin was adjusted accordingly according to the INRs during her hospital course. Early in the hospital course, the patient had reported right calf tenderness and a venous Doppler study obtained on 08/27/2007 showed no DVT bilaterally. Initial laboratory data includes a UA on 08/28/2007, which was negative. Additionally, CBC showed a white count of 6.3, hemoglobin was 12.1, hematocrit was 35.3, and platelets were 278,000. Chemistries were within normal limits. Creatinine was 0.8, BUN was 8, anion gap was slightly decreased at 5, fasting glucose was 102. The remainder of chemistries was unremarkable. The patient continued to make great progress with her therapies so much so that we are anticipating her discharge on Monday, 09/03/2007. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Status post right total knee replacement secondary to degenerative joint disease performed on 08/21/2007. 2. Anxiety disorder. 3. Insomnia secondary to pain and anxiety postoperatively. 4.

" HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 50-year-old white male complaining of continued lower back pain. Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago. He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he &quot;felt it&quot; in his lower back. The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients. He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well. He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture. He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain. He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain. The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs. Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time. The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X. He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night. The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend. Patient states he also has methadone and Darvocet at home from previous prescription and is wondering if he should restart these medicines. He is on several medications, the list of which is attached to the chart. MEDICATIONS: In addition to the aforementioned medications, he is on Cymbalta, pantoprazole, and a multivitamin. ALLERGIES: HE IS ALLERGIC TO RELAFEN (ITCHING). SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives with his wife. Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: Pulse is elevated at 105. Temp and other vitals signs are all within normal limits. GENERAL: Patient is a middle-aged white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress. BACK: Exam of the back shows some generalized tenderness on palpation of the musculature surrounding the lumbar spine, more so on the right than on the left. There is a well-healed upper lumbar incision from his previous L1-L2 fusion. There is no erythema, ecchymosis, or soft-tissue swelling. Mobility is generally very good without obvious signs of discomfort. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. LUNGS: Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes. MUSCULOSKELETAL: With the patient supine, there is some discomfort in the lower back with bent-knee flexion of both hips as well as with straight leg abduction of the left leg. There is some mild discomfort on internal and external rotation of the hips as well. DTRs are 1+ at the knees and trace at the ankles. I explained to the patient that he is suffering from a chronic condition and as his PCP has made it clear that he is unwilling to prescribe opiate medication, which the patient feels that he needs, and he is obligated to follow up at the pain clinic as suggested by the other physician even if he is having a &quot;good day.&quot; I explained to him that if he did not investigate other alternatives to what his PCP is willing to prescribe, then on a &quot;bad day,&quot; he will have nowhere else to turn. I explained to him that some emergency physicians do chose to use opiates for a short term as Dr. X did last night. It is unclear if the patient is looking for a different opiate medication, but I do not think it is wise to give him more, particularly as he has not even filled the prescription that was given to him last night. I did suggest that he not restart his methadone and Darvocet at this time as he is already on five different medications for his back (Celebrex, tramadol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and the Vicodin that he was given last night). I did suggest that we could try a different anti-inflammatory if he felt that the Celebrex is not helping. The patient is agreeable to this. ASSESSMENT 1. Lumbar muscle strain. 2. Chronic back pain. PLAN: At this point in time, I felt that it was safe for the patient to transition to heat to his back which he may use as often as possible. Rx for Voltaren 75 mg tabs, dispensed 20, sig. one p.o. q.12h. for pain instead of Celebrex. He may continue with his other medications as directed but not the methadone or Darvocet. I did urge him to reschedule his pain clinic appointment as he was urged to do originally. If unimproved this week, he should follow up with Dr. Y.",FALSE
" PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Osteoporosis, pathologic fractures T12- L2 with severe kyphosis. POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Osteoporosis, pathologic fractures T12- L2 with severe kyphosis. PROCEDURE: 1. KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty at T12 and L1evels Insertion of KYPHON HV-R bone cement under low pressure at T12 and L1 levels. 2. Bone biopsy (medically necessary). ANESTHESIA: General COMPLICATIONS: None BLOOD LOSS: Minimal INDICATIONS: Mrs. Smith is a 75-year-old female who has had severe back pain that began approximately three months ago and is debilitating. She has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modalities including bed rest and analgesics. She presents with and is on medication therapy for COPD, diabetes and hypertension (other co-morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note). Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine including T12, L1 and L2. In addition to the fractures, she presents with kyphotic posture. Films on 1/04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures. Films on 2/04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1. Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1. The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old. The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity. Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed. The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table. The back was prepped and draped. The image intensifier (C-arm) was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker. In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate. An 11-gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side. Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane. Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed. A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex. AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory. Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision was made. The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place. The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle. Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall. Through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel. The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex. After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex. The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images. The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body. Once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi. Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position. The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging. The final balloon volume was 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left. There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body. Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved. Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement. The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side. Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed. At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12. An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved. Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning. Post-procedure, all incisions were closed with sutures. The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection. She was then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor. She was moving both her lower extremities at this time. Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications. Estimated blood loss was minimal.",FALSE

OPERATION: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in supine position where general anesthesia was administered. Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leaning edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected with only blunt dissection. With only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and longus colli muscle was cauterized along the mesial border and self-retaining retractors were placed to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case. An intraoperative x-ray confirmed the interspace at C5-C6, C4-C5, and C6-C7 with prominent anterior osteophytes removed at C5-C6 noting particular disc collapse and far worsening spondylosis at C5-C6 than anywhere else in the neck. The annulus was cauterized and sharply excised and a discectomy followed with removing degenerated fragments of discs, which were sent to Pathology for permanent section in a routine fashion with straight disc forceps as needed, with residual discs drilled away as drilling extended from normal cortical cancellous elements with rather osteoporotic vertebral bodies noted. Prominent osteophytes were removed on the right side far more prominently on the left side with the worst compression on the nerve roots on the left, and all these were decompressed widely laterally bilaterally to completely decompress the dura, and the ligament as well, performed with a 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeur as necessary. The dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status finally and the entire area was inspected and at no time during the case there was evidence of CSF leakage of any type. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and an appropriate size Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position and was quite tightly applied. Further stability was added regardless with an appropriate size Uniplate with appropriate size screws and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and satisfactory postioning. After further inspection, the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and closed in a routine fashion with approximation of the platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl reinforced with Steri-Strips. A Penrose drain was carried from the prevertebral space externally with the skin wound and safety pin for security and incorporated later into a sterile bandage in a routine fashion. The patient was then taking from the operative room and extubated to the recovery area having left in stable condition. At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct and there were no intraoperative complications of any type.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lateral malleolus fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lateral malleolus fracture. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open reduction and internal fixation of left lateral malleolus. ANESTHESIA: General. TOURNIQUET TIME: 59 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Negligible. CLOSURE: 2-0 Vicryl and staples. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: This is a young gentleman with soccer injury to his left ankle and an x-ray showed displaced lateral malleolus fracture with widening of the mortise now for ORIF. The risks and perceivable complications of the surgeries were discussed with the patient via a translator as well as nonsurgical treatment options and this was scheduled emergently. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative room where general anesthesia was successfully introduced. The right ankle was prepped and draped in standard fashion. The tourniquet was applied about the right upper thigh. An Esmarch tourniquet was used to exsanguinate the ankle. The tourniquet was insufflated to a pressure 325 mm for approximately 59 minutes. An approximately 6 inch longitudinal incision was made just over the lateral malleolus. Care was taken to spare overlying nerves and vessels. An elevator was used to expose the fracture. The fracture was freed of old hematoma and reduced with a reducing clamp. An interfragmentary cortical screw was placed of 28 mm with excellent purchase. The intraoperative image showed excellent reduction. A 5-hole semitubular plate was then contoured to the lateral malleolus and fixed with 3 cortical screws proximally and 2 cancellous screws distally. Excellent stability of fracture was achieved.

PREOPERATIVE NOTE: This patient is a 47-year-old male with chief complaint of severe neck pain and left upper extremity numbness and weakness. Preoperative MRI scan showed evidence of herniated nucleus pulposus at C5-C6 and C6-C7 on the left. The patient has failed epidural steroid injections. Risks and benefits of the above procedure were discussed with the patient including bleeding, infection, muscle loss, nerve damage, paralysis, and death. OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient was taken to the OR and placed in the supine position. After general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient's neck was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A horizontal incision was made on the left side of the neck at the level of the C6 vertebral body. It was taken down through the subcutaneous tissues exposing the platysmus muscle. The platysmus muscle was incised along the skin incision and the deep cervical fascia was bluntly dissected down to the anterior cervical spine. An #18 gauge needle was placed in the C5-C6 interspace and the intraoperative x-ray confirmed that this was the appropriate level. Next, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally on both the right and left side, and then a complete anterior cervical discectomy was performed. The disk was very degenerated and brown in color. There was an acute disk herniation through posterior longitudinal ligament. The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and a bilateral foraminotomy was performed. Approximately, 5 mm of the nerve root on both the right and left side was visualized. A ball-ended probe could be passed up the foramen. Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo. The end plates of C5 and C6 were prepared using a high-speed burr and a 6-mm lordotic machined allograft was malleted into place. There was good bony apposition both proximally and distally. Next, attention was placed at the C6-C7 level. Again, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally and a complete anterior cervical discectomy at C6-C7 was performed. The disk was degenerated and there was acute disk herniation in the posterior longitudinal ligament on the left. The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed. A bilateral foraminotomy was performed. Approximately, 5 mm of the C7 nerve root was visualized on both sides. A micro nerve hook was able to be passed up the foramen easily.

" PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given anesthetic. Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed. It revealed no patholigamentous laxity. We then placed the patient into a beach-chair position, maintaining a neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax. The shoulder was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. We then injected the glenohumeral joint with 60 cc of sterile saline solution. A small stab incision was made 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion. Through this incision, a blunt trocar was placed. We then placed the camera through this cannula and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline solution. An anterior portal was made just below the subscapularis and then we began to inspect the shoulder joint. We found that the articular surface was in good condition. The biceps was found to be intact. There was a SLAP tear noted just posterior to the biceps. Pictures were taken. No Bankart or Hill-Sachs lesions were noted. The rotator cuff was examined and there were no undersurface tears. Pictures were again taken. We then made a lateral portal going through the muscle belly of the rotator cuff. A drill hole was made and then knotless suture anchor was placed to repair this. Pictures were taken. We then washed out the joint with copious amounts of sterile saline solution. It was drained. Our 3 incisions were closed using 3-0 nylon suture. A pain pump catheter was introduced into the shoulder joint. Xeroform, 4 x 4s, ABDs, tape, and sling were placed.

Displaced intraarticular fracture, right distal radius. 2. Right carpal tunnel syndrome. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Open reduction and internal fixation of right distal radius fracture - intraarticular four piece fracture. 2. Right carpal tunnel release. ANESTHESIA: General. CLINICAL SUMMARY: The patient is a 37-year-old right-hand dominant Hispanic female who sustained a severe fracture to the right wrist approximately one week ago. This was an intraarticular four-part fracture that was displaced dorsally. In addition, the patient previously undergone a carpal tunnel release, but had symptoms of carpal tunnel preop. She is admitted for reconstructive operation. The symptoms of carpal tunnel were present preop and worsened after the injury. OPERATION: The patient was brought from the ambulatory care unit and placed on the operating table in a supine position and administered general anesthetic by Anesthesia. Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Tourniquet was placed around the right upper extremity. The upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch dressing. The tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The entire operation was performed with 4.5 loop magnification. At this time an approximately 8 cm longitudinal incision was then made overlying the right flexor carpi radialis tendon from the flexion crease to the wrist proximally. This was carried down to the flexor carpi radialis, which was then retracted ulnarly. The floor of the flexor carpi radialis was then incised exposing the flexor pronator muscles. The flexor pollicis longus was retracted ulnarly and the pronator quadratus was longitudinally incised 1 cm from its origin. It was then elevated off of the fracture site exposing the fracture site, which was dorsally displaced. This was an intraarticular four-part fracture. Under image control, the two volar pieces and dorsal pieces were then carefully manipulated and reduced. Then, 2.06 two-inch K-wires were drilled radial into the volar ulnar fragment and then a second K-wire was then drilled from the dorsal radial to the dorsal ulnar piece. A third K-wire was then drilled from the volar radial to the dorsal ulnar piece. The fracture was then manipulated. The fracture ends were copiously irrigated with normal saline and curetted and then the fracture was reduced in the usual fashion by recreating the defect and distracting it. Further K-wires were then placed through the radial styloid into the proximal fragment. A Hand Innovations DVR plate of regular size for the right wrist was then fashioned over and placed over the distal radius and secured with two K-wires. At this time, the distal screws were then placed. The distal screws were the small screws. These were non-locking screws, all eight screws were placed. They were placed in the usual fashion by drilling with a small drill bit removing the small introducers and then using its depth. Again, these were 18-20 mm screws. After placing three of the screws it was necessary to remove the K-wires. There was excellent reduction of the fragments and the fracture; excellent reduction of the intraarticular component and the fracture. After the distal screws were placed, the fracture was reduced and held in place with K-wires, which were replaced and the proximal screws were drilled with the drill guide and the larger drill bit. The screws were then placed. These were 12 mm screws. They were placed 4 in number. The K-wires were then removed. Finally, a 3 cm intrathenar incision was made beginning 1 cm distal to the flexor crease of the wrist. This was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament, which was divided throughout the length of the incision, upon entering the carpal canal, the median nerve was found to be adherent to the undersurface of the structure. It was dissected free from the structure out to its trifurcation. The motor branches seen entering the thenar fascia and obstructed. The nerve was then retracted dorsally and the patient had a great deal of scar tissue in the area of the volar flexion crease to the wrist where she had a previous incision that extended from the volar flexion crease of the wrist overlying the palmaris longus proximally for 1 cm. In this area, careful dissection was performed in order to move the nerve from the surrounding structures and the most proximal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament, the more proximally located volar carpal ligament was then divided 5 cm into the distal forearm on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon. Incisions were then copiously irrigated with normal saline. Homeostasis was maintained with electrocautery. The pronator quadratus was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the above skin incisions were closed proximally with 4-0 nylon and palmar incision with 5-0 nylon in the horizontal mattress fashion. A large bulky dressing was then applied with a volar short-arm splint maintaining the wrist in neutral position. The tourniquet was let down. The fingers were immediately pink. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no operative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well.",TRUE

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tailor's bunion and neuroma of the second and third interspace, left foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Tailor's bunionectomy with metatarsal osteotomy of the left fifth metatarsal. 2. Excision of nerve lesion with implantation of the muscle belly of the left second interspace. 3. Excision of nerve lesion in the left third interspace. ANESTHESIA: Monitored IV sedation with local. HISTORY: This is a 37-year-old female who presents to ABCD's preoperative holding area, n.p.o. since mid night, last night for surgery of her painful left second and third interspaces and her left fifth metatarsal. The patient has attempted conservative correction and injections with minimal improvement. The patient desires surgical correction at this time. The patient states that her pain has been increasingly worsening with activity and with time and it is currently difficult for her to ambulate and wear shoes. At this time, the patient desires surgical intervention and correction. The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X and consent was obtained. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was taken to the Operating Suite via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position. A safety strap was placed across her waist for protection. Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied around her left ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection. After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of a mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1 cc of Solu-Medrol per 10 cc dose was administered to the patient for local anesthesia. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic manner. The foot was then elevated and a tourniquet was then placed at 230 mmHg after applying Esmarch bandage. The foot was then lowered down the operative field and sterile stockinet was draped. The stockinet was then reflected. Attention was then directed to the second intermetatarsal interspace. After testing the anesthesia, a 4 cm incision was placed using a #10 blade over the dorsal surface of the foot in the second intermetatarsal space beginning from proximal third of the metatarsals distally to and beyond the metatarsal head. Then, using #15 blade the incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue. Care was taken to identify and avoid or to cauterize any local encountered vascular structures. Incision was deepened using the combination of blunt and dull dissection using Mayo scissors, hemostat, and a #15 blade. The incision was deepened distally down to the level of the deep transverse metatarsal ligament which was reflected and exposure of the intermetatarsal space was appreciated. The individual branches of the plantar digital nerve were identified extending into the second and third digits plantarly. These endings were dissected distally and cut at their most distal portions. Following this, the nerve was dissected proximally into the common nerve and dissected proximally into the proximal portion of the intermetatarsal space. Using careful meticulous dissection, there was noted to a be a enlarged bulbous mass of fibers and nerve tissue embedded with the adipose tissue. This was also cut and removed. The proximal portion of the nerve stump was identified and care was taken to suture this into the lumbrical muscle to leave no free nerve ending exposed. Following this, the interspace was irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline and interspace explored for any other portions of nerve which may been missed on the previous dissection. It was noted that no other portions of the nerve were detectable and the proximal free nerve ending was embedded and found to be ________ the lumbrical muscle belly. Following this, the interspace was packed using iodoform gauze packing and was closed in layers with the packing extruding from the wound. Attention was then directed to the third interspace where in a manner as mentioned before. A dorsal linear incision which measured 5 cm was made over the third interspace extending from the proximal portion of the metatarsal distally to the metatarsal head. Like before, using a combination of blunt and dull dissection, with sharp dissection the incision was deepened down with care taken to cauterize all retracting vascular structures which were encountered. The incision was deepened down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue and then down deeper to the interspace of the third and fourth metatarsal. The dissection was deepened distally down to the level of the transverse intermetatarsal ligament, where upon this was reflected and the nerve fibers to the third and fourth digit plantarly were identified. These were once again dissected distally out and transected at their most distal portions. Care was then taken to dissect the nerve proximally into the proximal metatarsal region. No other branches of the nerve were identified and the nerve in its entirety along with fibrous tissue encountered in the area was removed. The proximal portion of the nerve which remained was not large enough to suture into lumbrical muscle as was done in the previous interspace. Half of the nerve was transected proximally as was feasible and no exposed ending was noted. Incision was then flushed and irrigated using sterile saline. Following this, the incision wound was packed with iodoform gauze packed and closed in layers using as before #4-0 Vicryl and #4-0 nylon suture. Following this, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head where a lateral 4 cm incision was placed along the lateral distal shaft and head of the fifth metatarsal using a fresh #10 blade. The incision was then deepened using #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue. Care was taken to reflect any neurovascular structures which were encountered. Following this the incision was deepened down to the level of the periosteum and periosteum was reflected, using the sharp dissection, to expose the head of the metatarsal along with the neck region. After adequate exposure of the fifth metatarsal head was achieved, an oblique incision directed from distal lateral to proximal medial in a sagittal plane was performed and the head of the fifth metatarsal was shifted medially. Following this, an OrthoSorb pin was retrograded through the fifth metatarsal head into the neck of the fifth metatarsal and was cut off first with the lateral surfaces of bone. OrthoSorb pin was noted to be intact and the fifth metatarsal head was in good alignment and position. Following this, the sagittal saw and the #138 blade were used to provide rasping and smoothing of the sharp acute edges of bone laterally. Following this, the periosteum was closed using #4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in layers using #4-0 Vicryl and closed with running subcuticular #4-0 Monocryl suture. Upon completion of this, the foot was noted to be in good position with good visual alignment of the fifth metatarsal head and digit. The incisions in foot were then ________ draped in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Kerlix and covered with Coban bandage. The tourniquet was then deflated with the total tourniquet time of 103 minutes at 230 mmHg and immediate hyperemia was noted to end digits one through five of the left foot. The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications. The patient was then given prescriptions for Vicoprofen #30 and Augmentin #14 to be taken twice daily. The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. X after the weekend on Tuesday in his office. The patient also given postoperative instructions and was placed in a postoperative shoe and instructed to limit weightbearing to the heel only, ice and elevate her foot 20 minutes every hour as tolerated. The patient also instructed to take her medications and prescriptions as directed. She was given the emergency contact numbers.

SPECIMENS: Disc that was not sent to the lab. DRAINS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. SURGICAL PROGNOSIS: Remains guarded due to her ongoing pain condition and Tarlov cyst at the L5 nerve root distally. SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is a 51-year-old female who has had unrelenting low back pain that radiated down her left leg for the past several months. The symptoms were unrelieved by conservative modalities. The symptoms were interfering with all aspects of daily living and inability to perform any significant work endeavors. She is understanding the risks, benefits, potential complications, as well as all treatment alternatives. She wished to proceed with the aforementioned surgery due to her persistent symptoms. Informed consent was obtained. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to OR room #5 where she was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia. She was subsequently placed on the Jackson spinal table with the Wilson attachment in the prone position. Palpation did reveal the iliac crest and suspected L5-S1 interspace. Thereafter the lumbar spine was serially prepped and draped. A midline incision was carried over the spinal process of L5 to S1. Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply. Electrocautery provided hemostasis. Electrocautery was then utilized to dissect through the subcutaneous tissues to the lumbar fascia. Lumbar fascia was identified and the decussation of fibers was identified at the L5-S1 interspace. On the left side, superior aspect dissection was carried out with the Cobb elevator and electrocautery. This revealed the interspace of suspect level of L5-S1 on the left. A Kocher clamp was placed between the spinous processes of the suspect level of L5-S1. X-ray did confirm the L5-S1 interval. Angled curet was utilized to detach the ligamentum flavum from its bony attachments at the superior edge of S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina. Meticulous dissection was undertaken and the ligamentum flavum was removed. Laminotomy was created with Kerrison rongeur, both proximally and distally. The microscope was positioned and the dura was inspected. A blunt Penfield elevator was then utilized to dissect and identify the L5-S1 nerve root on the left. It was noted to be tented over a disc extrusion. The nerve root was protected and medialized. It was retracted with a nerve root retractor. This did reveal a subligamentous disc herniation at approximately the L5-S1 disc space and neuroforaminal area. A #15 Bard-Parker blade was utilized to create an annulotomy. Medially, disc material was extruding through this annulotomy. Two tier rongeur was then utilized to grasp the disc material and the disc was removed from the interspace. Additional disc material was then removed, both to the right and left of the annulotomy. Up and downbiting pituitary rongeurs were utilized to remove any other loose disc pieces. Once this was completed, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. The Penfield elevator was placed in the disc space of L5-S1 and a crosstable x-ray did confirm this level. Nerve root was again expected exhibiting the foramina. A foraminotomy was created with a Kerrison rongeur. Once this was created, the nerve root was again inspected and deemed free of tension. It was mobile within the neural foramina. The wound was again copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. A free fat graft was then harvested from the subcutaneous tissues and placed over the exposed dura. Lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl interrupted fashion, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, and #4-0 undyed Vicryl was utilized to approximate the skin.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is a 45-year-old right-handed gentleman who presented with neck and right arm radicular pain. The pain has become more and more severe. It runs to the thumb and index finger of the right hand and it is accompanied by numbness. If he tilts his neck backwards, the pain shoots down the arm. If he is working with the computer, it is very difficult to use his mouse. He tried conservative measures and failed to respond, so he sought out surgery. Surgery was discussed with him in detail. A C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was recommended. He understood and wished to proceed with surgery. Thus, he was brought in same day for surgery on 07/03/2007. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: He was given Ancef 1 g intravenously for infection prophylaxis and then transported to the OR. There general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. He was positioned on the OR table with an IV bag between the scapulae. The neck was slightly extended and taped into position. A metal arch was placed across the neck and intraoperative x-ray was obtain to verify a good position for skin incision and the neck was prepped with Betadine and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A linear incision was created in the neck beginning just to the right of the midline extending out across the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The incision was extended through skin, subcutaneous fat, and platysma. Hemostasis was assured with Bovie cautery. The anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified and dissection was carried medial to this down to the carotid sheath. The trachea and the esophagus were swept out of the way and dissection proceeded medial to the carotid sheath down between the two bellies of the longus colli muscle on to the anterior aspect of the spine. A Bovie cautery was used to mobilize the longus colli muscle around initially what turned out to be C6-C7 disk based on x-rays and then around the C5-C6 disk space. An intraoperative x-ray confirmed C5-C6 disk space had been localized and then the self-retained distraction system was inserted to maintain exposure. A 15-blade knife was used to incise the C5-C6 disk and remove disk material. and distraction pins were inserted into C5-C6 and distraction placed across the disk space. The operating microscope was then brought into the field and used throughout the case except for the closure. Various pituitaries, #15 blade knife, and curette were used to evacuate the disk as best as possible. Then, the Midas Rex drill was taken under the microscope and used to drill where the cartilaginous endplate driven back all the way into the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. A nerve hook was swept underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and a fragment of disk was produced and was pulled up through the ligament. A Kerrison rongeur was used to open up the ligament in this opening and then to march out in the both neural foramina. A small amount of disk material was found at the right neural foramen. After a good decompression of both neural foramina was obtained and the thecal sac was exposed throughout the width of the exposure, the wound was thoroughly irrigated. A spacing mechanism was intact into the disk space and it was determined that a #7 spacer was appropriate. So, a #7 machine bone implant was taken and tapped into disk space and slightly counter sunk. The wound was thoroughly irrigated and inspected for hemostasis. A Mystique plate 23 mm in length was then inserted and anchored to the anterior aspect of C5-C6 to hold the bone into position and the wound was once again irrigated. The patient was valsalved. There was no further bleeding seen and intraoperative x-ray confirmed a good position near the bone, plate, and screws and the wound was enclosed in layers. The 3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate platysma and 3-0 Vicryl was used in inverted interrupted fashion to perform a subcuticular closure of the skin. The wound was cleaned. Mastisol was placed on the skin, and Steri-strips were used to approximate skin margins. Sterile dressing was placed on the patient's neck. He was extubated in the OR and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. There were no complications.",FALSE

At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan. The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found. It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma. Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005. The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments. Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ. She ordered an MRI of his neck. Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck. CURRENT SYMPTOMS: The patient describes his current pain as being intermittent. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Illnesses: The patient had a diagnosis in 2005 of an acoustic neuroma. It was benign, but treated neurosurgically. In February 2004 and again in August 2009 he has had additional treatments for recurrence and he currently has some skull markers in place because radiation is planned as a followup, although the tumor was still indicated to be benign. Operations: He has a history of an old mastoidectomy. He has a past history of removal of an acoustic neuroma in 2005 as noted. Medications: The patient takes occasional Tylenol and occasional Aleve. Substance Use: Tobacco: He does not smoke cigarettes. Alcohol: He drinks about five beers a week. FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of mesothelioma and his mother died of Lou Gehrig's disease. SOCIOECONOMIC HISTORY: Marital Status and Dependents: The patient has been married three times; longest marriage is of two years duration. He has two children. These dependents are ages 15 and twins and are his wife's dependents. Education: The patient has bachelor's degree. Military History: He served six years in the army and received an honorable discharge. Work History: He has worked at Purdy Correctional Institute in Gig Harbor for 19 years. CHART REVIEW: Review of the chart indicates a date of injury of November 20, 2008. He was seen at Tacoma General Hospital with a diagnosis of head contusion and cervical strain. He had a CT of his head done because of a fall with possible loss of consciousness, which showed a left cerebellar hypodensity and further evaluation was recommended. He has a history of an old mastoidectomy. He was then seen on November 24, 2008 by XYZ at Prompt Care on November 24, 2008. There is no clearcut history that he had lost consciousness. He has a past history of removal of an acoustic neuroma in 2005 as noted. A diagnosis of concussion and cervical strain status post fall was made along with an underlying history of abnormal CT and previous resection of an acoustic neuroma. Some symptoms of loss of balance and confusion were noted. She recommended additional testing and neurologic evaluation. The notes from the treating chiropractor begin on November 24, 2008. Adjustments are given to the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. He was seen back by XYZ on December 9, 2008 and he had been released to full duties. It was recognized the new MRI suggested recurrence of the acoustic neuroma and he was advised to seek further care in this regard. There were some concerns of his feeling of being wobbly since the fall which might be related to the recurrent neuroma. He continued to have chiropractic adjustments. He was seen back at Prompt Care on January 8, 2009. Dr. X indicated that she thought most of his symptoms were related to the tumor, but that the cervical and thoracic stiffness were from the fall. A followup note by his chiropractor on January 26, 2009 indicates that cervical x-rays have been taken and that continued chiropractic adjustments along with manual traction would be carried out. On April 13, 2009, he was seen again at Prompt Care for his cervical and thoracic strain. He was indicated to be improving and there was suggestion that he has some physical therapy and an orthopedic consult was felt appropriate. Therapy was not carried out and obviously was then involved with the treatment of his recurrent neuroma. On April 17, 2009, he was seen by Dr. X, another chiropractor for consultation and further chiropractic treatments were recommended based on cervical and thoracolumbar subluxation complexes and strain. A repeat consult was carried out on April 29, 2009 by XYZ. He felt that this was hyperextension cervical injury. It might take a period of time to recover. He mentioned that the patient might have a slight ulnar neuropathy. He felt the patient was capable of full duty and the patient was at that time having ongoing treatment for his neuroma. This concludes the chart review. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is 6 feet in height, weighs 255 pounds. Orthopedic Examination: He can walk with a normal gait, but he has, as indicated, a positive Romberg test and he himself has noticed that if he closes his eyes he loses his balance. Overall the patient is a seemingly good historian. There is a visible 3 cm scar at the left base of the neck near the hairline and there are multiple areas where his head has been shaved both anteriorly and posteriorly. These are secondary to drawing for the skull markers. There is a scar behind the patient's left ear from the original treatment of the acoustic neuroma. This was well healed. The patient can perform a toe-heel gait without difficulty. One visibly can see that he has some facial asymmetry and he indicates that the acoustic neuroma has caused some numbness in the left side of his face and also some asymmetry that is now recovering. The patient states he now thinks his recovery is going to get disregarded and that the facial asymmetry and numbness developed from the first surgery he had. The patient has a full range of motion in both of his shoulders. The patient has a full range of motion in his lumbar spine to include 90 degrees of forward bend, lateral bending of 30 degrees in either direction and extension of 10 degrees. There is full range of motion in the patient's cervical spine to include flexion of 50 degrees at which time he can touch his chin on his chest. He extends 40 degrees, laterally bends 30 degrees, and rotates to 80 degrees in either direction. There is slight tenderness on palpating over the right cervical musculature. There is no evidence of any cervical or lumbar muscle spasms. Reflexes in the upper extremities include 1+ biceps and triceps and 1+ brachioradialis. Knee jerks are 2+ and ankle jerks are 1+. Tinel's test was tested at the elbow, it is negative bilaterally with percussion; however, he has slight tingling bilaterally. The patient's grip tested with a Jamar dynamometer increases from 70 to 80 pounds bilaterally. Sensory testing of lower extremities reveal that the patient has slightly decreased sensation to sharp stimulus in his dorsal aspect of the right first toe and a lesser extent to the left. Testing of muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities is normal. The patient upper arms measured four fingerbreadths above the flexion crease of the elbow measure 35 cm bilaterally. The forearms measured four fingerbreadths below the flexion crease of the elbow measure 30 cm bilaterally. The thighs measured four fingerbreadths above the superior pole of the patella measure 48 cm and the lower legs measured four fingerbreadths below the tibial tubercles measure 41 cm. Pressure on the vertex of the head does not bother the patient. Axial loading is negative. As already indicated straight leg raising is entirely negative both sitting and lying for any radiculitis. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: X-rays the patient brings with him taken by his treating chiropractor dated 11/24/08 showed that there appears to be a little bit of narrowing of the L4-5 disc space. The hip joints are normal. Views of his thoracic spine are normal. Cervical x-rays are in the file. These are of intermittent quality, but the views do show a very slight degree of anterior spurring at the C4-5 with possible slight narrowing of the disc. There is a view of the right shoulder that is unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: The accepted condition under the claim is a sprain of the neck, thoracic, and lumbar. DIAGNOSES: Diagnosis based on today's examination is a sprain of the cervical spine and lumbar spine superimposed upon some early degenerative changes. Additional diagnosis is one of recurrent acoustic neuroma, presumably benign with upcoming additional treatment of radiation plan. The patient also has a significant degree overweight for his height and it will be improved as he himself recognizes by some weight loss and exercise. DISCUSSION: He is fixed and stable at this time and his industrial case can be closed relative to his industrial injury of November 20, 2008. Further chiropractic treatments would be entirely palliative and serve no additional medical purpose due to the fact that he has very minimal symptoms and a basis for these symptoms based on mild or early degenerative changes in both cervical and lumbar spine. He is category I relative to the cervical spine under 296-20-240 and category I to the lumbosacral spine under WAC 296-20-270. His industrial case should be closed and there is, as indicated, no basis for any disability award.",TRUE
" PROCEDURES PERFORMED: C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy, allograft fusion, and anterior plating. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 57-year-old gentleman with refractory neck pain with single-level degeneration of the cervical spine and there was also some arm pain. We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion. The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication. The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut. He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded. The tape was placed and his arms were well padded. He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region. We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space. We then marked the disc space. We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space. We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates. We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well. We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone. We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space. We then sized a 23-mm plate. We inserted the screws nicely above and below. We tightened down the lock-nuts. We irrigated the wound. We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate. We then assured hemostasis once again. We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion. The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion. The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips were applied. Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this. We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs. I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case.",FALSE
" TITLE OF OPERATION: Austin bunionectomy with internal screw fixation, first metatarsal, left foot. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bunion deformity, left foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bunion deformity, left foot. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with 15 mL of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain. HEMOSTASIS: 45 minutes, left ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. MATERIALS USED: 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, as well as a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the OsteoMed Screw Fixation System. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position. After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites. The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg. The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique. The left ankle tourniquet was inflated. Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed directly over the first left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the left great toe. The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint. All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular attachments were mobilized from the head of the first left metatarsal. The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the left great toe and transversally resected from its insertion. A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint. The dorsomedial prominence of the first left metatarsal head was adequately exposed using sharp dissection and resected with the use of a sagittal saw. The same saw was used to perform an Austin-type bunionectomy on the capital aspect of the first left metatarsal head with its apex distal and its base proximal on the shaft of the first left metatarsal. The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation. The capital fragment of the first left metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first left metatarsal. Provisional fixation was achieved with two smooth wires that were inserted vertically to the dorsal osteotomy in a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction. The same wires were also used as guide wires for the insertion of a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed System upon insertion of the screws, which was accomplished using AO technique. The wires were removed. Fixation on the table was found to be excellent. Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was anatomical. The remaining bony prominence from the shaft of the first left metatarsal was then resected with a sagittal saw. The area was copiously flushed with saline. The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues. The incision site was reinforced with Steri-Strips. At this time, the patient's left ankle tourniquet was deflated. The time was 45 minutes. Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff. The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and an Ace bandage. The patient's left foot was then placed in a surgical shoe. The patient was then transferred to the recovered room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels. The patient was given pain medication and instructions on how to control her postoperative course. The patient was discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.",TRUE
" CC: Progressive lower extremity weakness. HX: This 52y/o RHF had a h/o right frontal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection, on 1/15/1991. She had been healthy until 1/6/91, when she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic type seizure during the night. She subsequently underwent an MRI brain scan and was found to have a right frontal enhancing lesion in the mesial aspect of the right frontal lobe at approximately the level of the coronal suture. There was minimal associated edema and no mass effect. Following extirpation of the tumor mass, she underwent radioactive Iodine implantation and 6020cGy radiation therapy in 35 fractions. In 11/91 she received BCNU and Procarbazine chemotherapy protocols. This was followed by four courses of 5FU/Carboplatin (3/92, 6/92, 9/92 ,10/92) chemotherapy. On 10/12/92 she presented for her 4th course of 5FU/Carboplatin and complained of non-radiating dull low back pain, and proximal lower extremity weakness, but was still able to ambulate. She denied any bowel/bladder difficulty. PMH: s/p oral surgery for wisdom tooth extraction. FHX/SHX: 1-2 ppd cigarettes. rare ETOH use. Father died of renal CA. MEDS: Decadron 12mg/day.

Anterior instrumentation by Uniplate construction C5, C6, and C7 (22845); with intraoperative x-ray x2. ANESTHESIA: General. OPERATIONS: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position where general anesthesia was administered. Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues. Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7. Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen. This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well. This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed. At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam. Once hemostasis well achieved, Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements of appropriate size, and this was countersunk into position and quite tightly applied it at first C5-C6, then secondly at C6-C7. These were checked and found to be well applied and further stability was then added by placement nonetheless of a Uniplate of appropriate size. The appropriate size screws and post-placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and removal of osteophytes, etc. The wound was again irrigated with antibiotic solution, inspected, and finally closed in a multiple layered closure by approximation of platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl incorporating a Penrose drain from vertebral space externally through the skin wound and safety pin, and later incorporated itself into sterile bandage.

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 5-year, 5-month-old male who sustained a both-bone forearm fracture in September 2007. The fracture healed uneventfully, but then the patient subsequently suffered a refracture one month ago. The patient had shortening in arms, noted in both bones. The parents opted for surgical stabilization with nailing. This was performed one month ago on return visit. His ulnar nail was quite prominent underneath the skin. It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother. Risk of surgery incudes risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, need for longer casting. All questions were answered and mother agreed to above plan.

" REASON FOR VISIT: Followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and L4-L5 posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion on 06/08/07. Preoperatively, her symptoms, those of left lower extremity are radicular pain. She had not improved immediately postoperatively. She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw. We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw. Postoperatively, her pain had improved. I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well. She had symptoms of what she thought was &quot;restless leg syndrome&quot; at that time. She has been put on ReQuip for this. She returned. I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved. I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative. She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg. Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation. She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively. She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively. The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively. The right leg pain is improved. The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side. She denies any significant low back pain. No right lower extremity symptoms. No infectious symptoms whatsoever. No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath. No drainage from the wound. No difficulties with the incision. FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x 3. Normocephalic, atraumatic. Respirations are normal and nonlabored. Afebrile to touch. Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5. Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5. This has all been changed compared to preoperatively. Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5. Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot. Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally. The incision is well healed. There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever. No drainage. Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws. Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed. It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5. There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07. The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms. I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms. However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection. I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time. I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection. My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization. I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time. She is happy with this. I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible. She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested. I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management. I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve. She knows that if she has any difficulties, she may follow up with me sooner.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Recurrent herniation L4-5 disk with left radiculopathy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Recurrent herniation L4-5 disk with left radiculopathy. PROCEDURE: Redo L4-5 diskectomy left. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANTIBIOTIC (S): Vancomycin given preoperatively. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. BLOOD REPLACED: None. CRYSTALLOID GIVEN: 800 mL. DRAIN (S): None. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the operating room in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. He was turned into the prone position on the operating table and positioned in the modified knee-chest position with Andrews frame being used. Care was taken to protect pressure points. The back was shaved, scrubbed with Betadine scrub, rinsed with alcohol, and prepped with DuraPrep, and draped in the usual sterile fashion with Ioban drape being used. A midline skin incision was made, excising scar from previous surgery. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery technique. The lumbosacral fascia was split to the left of the spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection of the spinous process and lamina, area of previous laminotomy was identified. Cross-table lateral was also made to confirm position. The scar was then loosened from the inferior portion of 4, superior of L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. I did identify normal dura. The scar was then lysed from the medial wall. Dura and nerve root were identified and protected with nerve root retractor. The bulging disk fragment was still contained under the longitudinal ligament. A rent was made with the Penfield and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disk space was then entered with a cruciate cut in the annulus, with additional nuclear material being received. When no other fragments could be removed from the disk space, no other fragments were felt in the central canal under the longitudinal ligament, and a Murphy ball could be passed through the foramen without evidence of compression, the decompression was complete. Check was made for CSF leakage, and no evidence of significant epidural bleeding was present. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution. Twenty milligrams of Depo-Medrol was placed over the dura and nerve root. A free fat graft from the subcutaneous tissue was then placed over the dura. Closure was obtained with the lumbosacral fascia being reapproximated with #1, running, Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous closure was obtained in layers with 2-0, running, Vicryl suture. Skin closure was obtained with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular suture. Proxi-Strips and sterile dressing was applied. The skin had been infiltrated with 8 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine. After a sterile dressing was applied, the patient was turned into the supine position on the waiting recovery room stretcher, brought from under the effects of anesthesia, and taken to the recovery room.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus, L5-S1 on the left with severe weakness and intractable pain. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus, L5-S1 on the left with severe weakness and intractable pain. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Injection for myelogram. 2. Microscopic-assisted lumbar laminectomy with discectomy at L5-S1 on the left on 08/28/03. BLOOD LOSS: Approximately 25 cc. ANESTHESIA: General. POSITION: Prone on the Jackson table. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Extruded nucleus pulposus at the level of L5-S1. HISTORY: This is a 34-year-old male with history of back pain with radiation into the left leg in the S1 nerve root distribution. The patient was lifting at work on 08/27/03 and felt immediate sharp pain from his back down to the left lower extremity. He denied any previous history of back pain or back surgeries. Because of his intractable pain as well as severe weakness in the S1 nerve root distribution, the patient was aware of all risks as well as possible complications of this type of surgery and he has agreed to pursue on. After an informed consent was obtained, all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient. PROCEDURE DETAIL: He was wheeled back to Operating Room #5 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/28/03. After a general anesthetic was administered, a Foley catheter was inserted. The patient was then turned prone on the Jackson table. All of his bony prominences were well-padded. At this time, a myelogram was then performed. After the lumbar spine was prepped, a #20 gauge needle was then used to perform a myelogram. The needle was localized to the level of L3-L4 region. Once inserted into the thecal sac, we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle. At this time, approximately 10 cc of Conray injected into the thecal sac. The patient was then placed in the reversed Trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast. The myelogram did reveal that there was some space occupying lesion, most likely disc at the level of L5-S1 on the left. There was a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the AP and the lateral projections using C-arm fluoroscopy. At this point, the patient was then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy. A long spinal needle was then inserted into region of surgery on the right. The surgery was going to be on the left. Once the spinal needle was inserted, a localizing fluoroscopy was then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the L5-S1 nerve root region. At this time, an approximately 2 cm skin incision was made over the lumbar region, dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia. At this time, a Weitlaner was inserted. Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis. We further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process and the lamina. A Cobb elevator was then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process as well as the lamina on the left-hand side. At this time, a Taylor retractor was then inserted and held there for retraction. Suction as well as Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis. At this time, a small Kerrison Rongeur was used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression. Once the laminotomy was performed, a small _______ curette was used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac as well as the adjoining nerve roots. Once the ligamentum flavum was removed, we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the S1 nerve root, which was compressive. We removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the S1 nerve root. A nerve root retractor was then placed. Identification of disc space was then performed. A #15 blade was then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space was then performed with a #15 blade. A small pituitary was then inserted within the disc space and more disc material was freed and removed. The part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear pieces of disc. Once this was performed, we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root was essentially free. At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound. We then performed another look to see if any loose pieces of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small pieces were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur. At this time, a small piece of Gelfoam was then used to cover the exposed nerve root. We did not have any dural leaks during this case. #1-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia, #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia, and #4-0 running Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin. Sterile dressings were then applied. The patient was then carefully slipped over into the supine position, extubated and transferred to Recovery in stable condition. At this time, we are still waiting to assess the patient postoperatively to assure no neurological sequela postsurgically are found and also to assess his pain level.",FALSE

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with local infiltration of 5 mL of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain with 1:100,000 epinephrine preoperatively and 15 mL of 0.5% Marcaine postoperatively. HEMOSTASIS: Left ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg for 60 minutes. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. MATERIALS USED: 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Prolene, as well as one corticocancellous allograft consisting of ASIS and one T-type plate prebent with six screw holes and five 3.0 partially threaded cannulated screws and a single 3.0 noncannulated screw from the OsteoMed and Synthes System respectively for the fixation of the bone graft and the plate on the first left metatarsal. INJECTABLES: 1 g Ancef IV 30 minutes preoperatively and the afore-mentioned lidocaine. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. After general anesthesia was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites. The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg. The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique. The left ankle tourniquet was then inflated. Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first left metatarsal shaft where an 8-cm linear incision was placed directly parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon. The incision extended from the base of the first left metatarsal all the way to the first left metatarsophalangeal joint. The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. The incision was deepened to the level of the periosteum of the first left metatarsal. All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal tissues were mobilized from their attachments on the first left metatarsal shaft. Dissection was carried down to the level of the lose screw fixation and the two screws were identified and removed intact. The screws were sent to pathology for examination. The nonunion was also identified closer to the base of the first left metatarsal and using the sagittal saw the nonunion and some of the healthy tissue on both ends of the previous osteotomy were resected and sent to pathology for identification. The remaining two ends of the previous osteotomy were then fenestrated with the use of a 0.045 Kirschner wire to induce bleeding. The corticocancellous bone graft was prepped according to the instructions in saline for at least 60 minutes and then interposed in the previous area of the osteotomy. Provisional fixation with K-wires was achieved and also correction of the bunion deformity of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was also accomplished. The bone graft was then stabilized with the use of a T-type prebent plate with the use of fixed screws that were inserted using AO technique through the plate and the shaft of the first left metatarsal and compressed appropriately the graft. Removal of the K-wires and examination of fixation and graft incorporation into the previous nonunion area was found to be excellent. The area was flushed copiously flushed with saline. The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and 2-0 Vicryl suture material. All the subcutaneous tissues were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl suture material and 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges at this time. The left ankle tourniquet was deflated. Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff. The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage. The patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe. The patient was then transferred to the postanesthesia care unit with his vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels. The patient was given specific instructions and education on how to continue caring for his left foot surgery.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative osteoarthritis, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative osteoarthritis, right knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right knee total arthroplasty. ANESTHESIA: The procedure was done under a subarachnoid block anesthetic in the supine position with a tourniquet utilized. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: Approximately 90 minutes. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire procedure is done in the inpatient operating suite in the Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital. The following sizes of NexGen system were utilized: E on right femur, cemented; 5 tibial stem tray with a 10 mm polyethylene insert, and a 32 mm patellar button. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 58-year-old white female suffering increasing right knee pain for number of years prior to surgical intervention. She was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy. She had undergone two knee arthroscopies in the years preceding this. They were performed by myself. She ultimately failed this treatment and developed a collapsing-type valgus degenerative osteoarthritis with complete collapse and ware of the lateral compartment and degenerative changes noted to the femoral sulcus that were proved live. Medial compartment had minor changes present. There was no contracture of the lateral collateral ligament, but instead mild laxity on both sides. There was no significant flexion contracture preoperatively. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine upon the operating table after receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department. Thigh tourniquet was placed upon the patient's right leg. She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. The limb was elevated and exsanguinated and tourniquet placed 325 mmHg for the above noted time. A straight incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation. Medial parapatellar arthrotomy was created and the knee cap was everted. The ligaments were balanced. A portion of the fat pad was removed and the ACL was completely removed. Drill hole was made in the distal femur. The size to an E, right. Care was taken to make up for the severe loss of articular cartilage on the posterior condyle in the lateral side. This was checked with the epicondylar abscess and with three degrees of external rotation, drill holes were made. Intramedullary guide was then placed, pegged, and anterior cut carried out. There was excellent resection. It was flat. Distal cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus. Appropriate cuts were carried out. The standard cut was utilized. The finishing guide for E was held with pins as well as screws. Cutting was carried out posterior to anterior, then posterior chamfer and anterior chamfer, femoral sulcus cut was carried out and drill holes for pegs were made. The cutting guide was then removed. The bone was removed. Excess bone was taken out posteriorly. The posterior capsule was loosened up. There were two different fabellas in the posterolateral compartment and they were loosened. Posterolateral corner was then anchored with osteotome and was taken around the posterolateral corner. An extramedullary tibial cutting guide was then placed, pinned, and held. A cut was carried out parallel to the foot. Hard copy ________ was obtained, deemed to be satisfactory after evening up the edges. Trial range of motion was satisfactory. It was necessary to perform a lateral retinacular release to the patella. The patella was isolated. Approximately 10 mm to 11 mm were reamed off. The size to 32 mm button and drill hole guide was placed, impacted, and drilled. Trial range of motion was satisfactory. The tibial guide was then pinned. Drill hole was placed, broached, and utilized. Copious irrigation was carried out. Methylmethacrylate was mixed and was sequentially placed from the femur to the tibia to the patella. The implants were sequentially placed in tibia to femur to patella. Once excess methylmethacrylate was removed and cured, 10 mm Poly was placed. There was excellent ligament balancing. A separate portal was utilized for subcutaneous drain. Tourniquet was deflated and hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation. Interrupted #1 Ethibond suture was utilized for parapatellar closure, running #1 Vicryl suture was utilized for overstitch. Trial range of motion was satisfactory. Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed to the skin. Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing. Digits were pink and warm with brawny pulses distally at the end of the case. The patient was then transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.

" PROCEDURE: Bilateral L5, S1, S2, and S3 radiofrequency ablation. INDICATION: Sacroiliac joint pain. INFORMED CONSENT: The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient. The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks. The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications. I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids. The patient was informed both verbally and in writing. The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed. PROCEDURE: Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure. The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback. The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine. The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated. The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine. The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement. Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine. With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3. Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement. The following technique was used to confirm correct placement. Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration. No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts. Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached. At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue. After completion, a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 80 degrees for 90 seconds. All injected medications were preservative free. Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure. ADDITIONAL DETAILS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISCUSSION: Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable. The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day. The patient was told to resume all medications. The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function. Follow up appointment was made at PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately one to two weeks.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed type-III supracondylar fracture, left distal humerus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Closed type-III supracondylar fracture, left distal humerus. 2. Tethered brachial artery, left elbow. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Closed reduction percutaneous pinning, left distal humerus. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire operative procedure was done in the inpatient operating suite, room #2 at ABCD General Hospital. A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr. X with separate dictation by him. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing. He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm. He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow. His parents' were both present preoperatively. His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region. Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible. He did have a radial pulse palpable. PROCEDURE: After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations with the patient's parents including malunion, nonunion, gross deformity, growth arrest, infection, loss of elbow motions, stiffness, instability, need for surgery in the future, nerve problems, artery problems, and compartment syndrome, they elected to proceed. The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department. Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner. Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly. Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out. The elbow was hyperflexed. Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0.045 K-wires placed first, one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve. The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C-arm. After this, pulse was attempted to be palpated distally. Prior to the procedure, I talked to Dr. X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital. He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally. This was not present palpatory, but also by Doppler. A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler. Because of this, the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion-type sound just above the fracture site or _______. A long discussion was carried out with Dr. X and myself, and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery. Prior to this, I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient's parents, the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this. I then came back in and then we proceeded. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Please see Dr. X's report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery. There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site, the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site, thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally. Once it was released, both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler, the patient had bounding pulses. We then proceeded to close utilizing a #4-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure. Steri-Strips were placed. The patient's arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position. He was splinted posteriorly. Adaptic and fluffs have been placed around the patient's pin sites. K-wires have been bent, cut, and pin caps placed. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded for the obvious reasons noted above. There is concern for growth plate disturbance. He will be watched very closely for the potential development of re-perfusing compartment syndrome. A full and complete neurologic exam will be impossible tonight, but will be carried on a sequential basis starting tomorrow morning. There is always a potential for loss of elbow motion, overall cosmetic elbow alignment, and elbow function.",FALSE

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. GROSS FINDINGS: Include purulent material from the abscess located in the plantar aspect of the foot between the third and fourth metatarsal heads. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian male with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The patient states that he was working in his garage over the past few days when he noticed some redness and edema in his right foot. He notes some itching as well as increasing pain and redness in the right foot and presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room. He was evaluated by the Emergency Room staff as well as the medical team and the Department of Orthopedics. It was noted upon x-ray a foreign body in his foot and he had significant amount of cellulitis as well ________ right lower extremity. After a long discussion held with the patient, it was elected to proceed with irrigation debridement and removal of the foreign body. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, operative surgeon, the Department of Anesthesia and nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #5 and placed on the operating table in supine position. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The Department of Anesthesia was administered spinal anesthetic to the patient. Once this anesthesia was obtained, the patient's right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from. At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads. Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain. The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot. There was no obvious joint involvement. After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound. The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue. The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. DISPOSITION: The patient will be followed on a daily basis for possible repeat irrigation debridement.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy with cord compression and cervical spondylosis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy with cord compression and cervical spondylosis. In addition to this, he had a large herniated disk at C3-C4 in the midline. PROCEDURE: Anterior cervical discectomy fusion C3-C4 and C4-C5 using operating microscope and the ABC titanium plates fixation with bone black bone procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient placed in the supine position, the neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Incision was made in the midline the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid at the level of C4. Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and vertebral muscles divided longitudinally in the direction of the fibers and the trachea and esophagus was retracted medially. The carotid sheath was retracted laterally after dissecting the longus colli muscle away from the vertebral osteophytes we could see very large osteophytes at C4-C5. It appeared that the C5-C6 disk area had fused spontaneously. We then confirmed that position by taking intraoperative x-rays and then proceeded to do discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5. After placing distraction screws and self-retaining retractors with the teeth beneath the bellies of the longus colli muscles, we then meticulously removed the disk at C3-C4, C4-C5 using the combination of angled strip, pituitary rongeurs, and curettes after we had incised the anulus fibrosus with #15 blade. Next step was to totally decompress the spinal cord using the operating microscope and high-speed cutting followed by the diamond drill with constant irrigation. We then drilled off the uncovertebral osteophytes and midline osteophytes as well as thinning out the posterior longitudinal ligaments. This was then removed with 2-mm Kerrison rongeur. After we removed the posterior longitudinal ligament, we could see the dura pulsating nicely. We did foraminotomies at C3-C4 as well as C4-C5 as well. After having totally decompressed both the cord as well as the nerve roots of C3-C4, C4-C5, we proceeded to the next step, which was a fusion. We sized two 8-mm cortical cancellous grafts and after distracting the bone at C3-C4, C4-C5, we gently tapped the grafts into place. The distraction was removed and the grafts were now within. We went to the next step for the procedure, which was the instrumentation and stabilization of the fused area. We then placed a titanium ABC plate from C3-C5, secured it with 16-mm titanium screws. X-rays showed good position of the screws end plate. The next step was to place Jackson-Pratt drain to the vertebral fascia. Meticulous hemostasis was obtained.

PROCEDURES: Left knee arthroscopy with removal of the cartilage loose body and microfracture of the medial femoral condyle with chondroplasty. ANESTHESIA: General. TOURNIQUET TIME: Thirty-seven minutes. MEDICATIONS: The patient also received 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic at the end of the case. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications. DRAINS AND SPECIMENS: None. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a loose body that was found in the suprapatellar pouch upon entry of the camera. This loose body was then subsequently removed. It measured 24 x 14 mm. This was actually the OCD lesion seen on the MRI that had come from the weightbearing surface of just the lateral posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is 13-year-old male with persistent left knee pain. He was initially seen at Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group where an MRI demonstrated unstable OCD lesion of the left knee. The patient presented here for a second opinion. Surgery was recommended grossly due to the instability of the fragment. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed. The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, possible need for other surgical procedures, and possible early arthritis. All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above plan. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. The standard portals were marked on the skin. The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg. The portal incisions were then made by an #11 blade. Camera was inserted into the lateral joint line. There was a noted large cartilage loose body in the suprapatellar pouch. This was subsequently removed with extension of the anterolateral portal. Visualization of the rest of the knee revealed significant synovitis. The patient had a large cartilage defect in the posterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle. The remainder of the knee demonstrated no other significant cartilage lesions, loose bodies, plica or meniscal pathology. ACL was also visualized to be intact in the intracondylar notch. Attention was then turned back to the large defect. The loose cartilage was debrided using a shaver. Microfracture technique was then performed to 4 mm depth at 2 to 3 mm distances. Tourniquet was released at the end of the case to ensure that there was fat and bleeding at the microfracture sites. All instruments were then removed. The portals were closed using #4-0 Monocryl. A total of 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the knee. Wounds were then cleaned and dried, and dressed in Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and bias. The patient was then placed in a knee immobilizer. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The tourniquet was released at 37 minutes. He was taken to recovery in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The loose cartilage fragment was given to the family. The intraoperative findings were relayed with intraoperative photos. There was a large deficit in the weightbearing portion of medial femoral condyle. His prognosis is guarded given the fact of the fragile lesion and location, but in advantages of his age and his rehab potential down the road, if the patient still has symptoms, he may be a candidate for osteochondral autograft, a procedure which is not performed at Children's or possible cartilaginous transplant.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent anterior dislocating left shoulder. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent anterior dislocating left shoulder. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Arthroscopic debridement of the left shoulder with attempted arthroscopic Bankart repair followed by open Bankart arthroplasty of the left shoulder. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #2, administered general anesthetic after ineffective interscalene block had been administered in the preop area. The patient was positioned in the modified beachchair position utilizing the Mayfield headrest. The left shoulder was propped posteriorly with a rolled towel. His head was secured to the Mayfield headrest. The left shoulder and upper extremity were then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A posterior lateral port was made for _____ the arthroscopic cannula. The scope was introduced into the glenohumeral joint. There was noted to be a complete tear of the anterior glenoid labrum off from superiorly at about 11:30 extending down inferiorly to about 6 o'clock. The labrum was adherent to the underlying capsule. The margin of the glenoid was frayed in this area. The biceps tendon was noted to be intact. The articular surface of the glenoid was fairly well preserved. The articular surface on the humeral head was intact; however, there was a large Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head. The rotator cuff was visualized and noted to be intact. The axillary pouch was visualized and it was free of injury. There were some cartilaginous fragments within the axillary pouch. Attention was first directed after making an anterior portal to fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum. Utilizing the Chirotech system through the anterior cannula, the labrum was secured with the pin and drill component and was then tacked back to the superior glenoid rim at about the 11 o'clock position. A second tack was then placed at about the 8 o'clock position. The labrum was then probed and was noted to be stable. With some general ranging of the shoulder, the tissue was pulled out from the tacks. An attempt was made at placement of two other tacks; however, the tissue was not of good quality to be held in position. Therefore, all tacks were either buried down to a flat surface or were removed from the anterior glenoid area. At this point, it was deemed that an open Bankart arthroplasty was necessary. The arthroscopic instruments were removed. An anterior incision was made extending from just lateral of the coracoid down toward the axillary fold. The skin incision was taken down through the skin. Subcutaneous tissues were then separated with the coag Bovie to provide hemostasis. The deltopectoral fascia was identified. It was split at the deltopectoral interval and the deltoid was reflected laterally. The subdeltoid bursa was then removed with rongeurs. The conjoint tendon was identified. The deltoid and conjoint tendons were then retracted with a self-retaining retractor. The subscapularis tendon was identified. It was separated about a centimeter from its insertion, leaving the tissue to do sew later. The subscapularis was reflected off superiorly and inferiorly and the muscle retracted medially. This allowed for visualization of the capsule. The capsule was split near the humeral head insertion leaving a tag for repair. It was then split longitudinally towards the glenoid at approximately 9 o'clock position. This provided visualization of the glenohumeral joint. The friable labral and capsular tissue was identified. The glenoid neck was already prepared for suturing, therefore, three Mitek suture anchors were then positioned to place at approximately 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 10 o'clock. The sutures were passed through the labral capsular tissue and tied securely. At this point, the anterior glenoid rim had been recreated. The joint was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Vicryl suture and repaired back to its insertion site with #1 Vicryl suture. This later was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. Subscapularis was reapproximated on to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus utilizing interrupted #1 Vicryl suture. This later was then copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry. The deltoid fascia was approximated with running #2-0 Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous tissues were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was approximated with a running #4-0 subcuticular Vicryl followed by placement of Steri-Strips. 0.25% Marcaine was placed in the subcutaneous area for postoperative analgesia. The patient was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer after a bulky dressing had been applied. The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rotated cuff tear, right shoulder. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Rotated cuff tear, right shoulder. 2. Glenoid labrum tear. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopy with arthroscopic glenoid labrum debridement. 2. Subacromial decompression. 3. Rotator cuff repair, right shoulder. SPECIFICATIONS: Intraoperative procedure was done at Inpatient Operative Suite, room #1 at ABCD Hospital. This was done under interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beach chair position. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: The patient is a 48-year-old with male who has been suffering increasing right shoulder pain for a number of months prior to surgical intervention. He was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy. After discussing the alternative care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above stated procedure on this date. Intraarticularly, the joint was observed. There was noted to be a degenerative glenoid labrum tear. The biceps complex was otherwise intact. There were minimal degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joint. Rotator cuff tear was appreciated on the inner surface. Subacromially, the same was true. This was an elliptical to V-type tear. The patient has a grossly positive type III acromion. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine on the operating table after receiving interscalene and then general anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department. He was safely placed in modified beach chair position. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Portals were created outside to end, posterior to anterior, and ultimately laterally in the typical fashion. Upon complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint, a 4.2 meniscus shaver was placed anteriorly with the scope posteriorly. Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum. The biceps was probed and noted to be intact. Undersurface of the rotator cuff was debrided with the shaver along with debridement of the subchondral region of the greater tuberosity attachment. After this, instrumentation was removed. The scope was placed subacromially and a lateral portal created. Gross bursectomy was carried out in a stepwise fashion to the top part of the cuff as well as in the gutters. An anterolateral portal was created. Sutures were placed via express silk as well as other sutures with a #2 fiber wire. With passing of the suture, they were tied with a slip-tight knot and then two half stitches. There was excellent reduction of the tear. Superolateral portal was then created. A #1 Mitek suture anchor was then placed in the posterior cuff to bring this over to bleeding bone. _______ suture was placed. The implant was put into place. The loop was grabbed and it was impacted in the previously drilled holes. There was excellent reduction of the tear. Trial range of motion was carried out and seemed to be satisfactory. Prior to this, a subacromial decompression was accomplished after release of CA ligament with the vapor Bovie. A 4.8 motorized barrel burr was utilized to sequentially take this down from the type III acromion to a flat type I acromion. After all was done, copious irrigation was carried out throughout the joint. Gross bursectomy lightly was carried out to remove all bony elements. A pain buster catheter was placed through a separate portal and cut to length. 0.5% Marcaine was instilled after portals were closed with #4-0 nylon. Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing. The patient was ultimately transferred to his cart and PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Chondromalacia patella. 2. Patellofemoral malalignment syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Grade-IV chondromalacia patella. 2. Patellofemoral malalignment syndrome. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Diagnostic arthroscopy with partial chondroplasty of patella. 2. Lateral retinacular release. 3. Open tibial tubercle transfer with fixation of two 4.5 mm cannulated screws. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: Approximately 70 minutes at 325 mmHg. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Grade-IV chondromalacia noted to the central and lateral facet of the patella. There was a grade II to III chondral changes to the patellar groove. The patella was noted to be displaced laterally riding on the edge of the lateral femoral condyle. The medial lateral meniscus showed small amounts of degeneration, but no frank tears were seen. The articular surfaces and the remainder of the knee appeared intact. Cruciate ligaments also appeared intact to direct stress testing. HISTORY: This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain. She has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella. She has failed conservative therapy. It was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint. She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention. All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her. She was in agreement with the treatment plan. PROCEDURE: On 09/04/03, she was taken to Operating Room at ABCD General Hospital. She was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department. Her leg was placed in a Johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions. Through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution. Intraoperative pictures were obtained. The above findings were noted. Second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region. Through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris. Next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal. An arthroscopic Bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal. A release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the Bovie. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery. Next, the knee was suctioned dry. An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity. Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg. An oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee. The subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery. The retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision. The patellar tendon was identified. The lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris. Next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact. The tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her Q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle. It was then held in place with a Steinmann pin. Following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle. There was excellent fixation noted. The Q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees. She was transferred approximately 1 cm in length. The wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella. The retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 Vicryl. Subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed with #4-0 Vicryl running PDS suture. Sterile dressing was applied to the lower extremities. She was placed in a Donjoy knee immobilizer locked in extension. It was noted that the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill following deflation of the tourniquet. She was transferred to recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition. Prognosis of this patient is poor secondary to the advanced degenerative changes to the patellofemoral joint. She will remain in the immobilizer approximately six weeks allowing the tubercle to reapproximate itself to the proximal tibia.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Painful enlarged navicula, right foot. 2. Osteochondroma of right fifth metatarsal. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Painful enlarged navicula, right foot. 2. Osteochondroma of right fifth metatarsal. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Partial tarsectomy navicula, right foot. 2. Partial metatarsectomy, right foot. HISTORY: This 41-year-old Caucasian female who presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint. The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin. She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas. She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back. The patient desires surgical treatment at this time. PROCEDURE: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap. Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal. Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered as well as the operating table. The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot. The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted. A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence. At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site. The incision was then deepened with #15 blade. All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis. The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum. A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone. The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time. A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone. An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone. After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf. The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area. Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible. Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone. Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone. The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted. The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted. The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed. Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal. There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal. Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal. The incision was then deepened with #15 blade. Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon. The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head. Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly. At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal. A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences. All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp. The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted. The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl. Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line. Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed. Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites. Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated. The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office as directed or sooner if any problems or questions arise.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body, right foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Incision and drainage, right foot. 2. Removal of foreign body, right foot. HISTORY: This 7-year-old Caucasian male is an inpatient at ABCD General Hospital with a history of falling off his bike and having a root ________ angle inside of his foot. The patient has had previous I&D but continues to have to purulent drainage. The patient's parents agreed to performing a surgical procedure to further clean the wound. PROCEDURE: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap across his lap. General anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The stockinette was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. There was noted to be some remaining periwound erythema. There was noted to be some mild crepitation about 2 cm proximal from the entry wound. The entry wound was noted to be over the third metatarsal head dorsally. Upon inspection of the wound, there was noted to be hard foreign filling substance deep within the wound. The entry site from the foreign body was extended proximally approximately about 0.5 cm. At this time, a large wooden foreign body was visualized and removed with a straight stat. The area was carefully inspected for any remaining piece of foreign body. Several small pieces were noted and they were removed. The area was palpated and there was no more remaining foreign body noted. At this time, the wound was inspected thoroughly. There was noted to be an area along the third metatarsal head more distally that did probe to the bone. There was no purulent drainage expressed. Area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. Pulse lavage was performed with 3 liters of plain sterile saline. Wound cultures were obtained, aerobic and aerobic. The wound was then again inspected for any remaining foreign body or purulent drainage. None was noticed. The wound was packed with sterile new gauze packing lately and dressings consisted of 4x4s, ABDs, Kling, and Kerlix. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transported to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.

" DIAGNOSIS: Ankle sprain, left ankle. HISTORY: The patient is a 31-year-old female who was referred to Physical Therapy secondary to a fall on 10/03/08. The patient states that she tripped over her dog toy and fell with her left foot inverted. The patient states that she received a series of x-rays and MRIs that were unremarkable. After approximately 1 month, the patient continued to have significant debilitating pain in her left ankle. She then received a walking boot and has been in the boot for the past month. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension, asthma, and cervical cancer. The cervical cancer was diagnosed as 15 years old. The patient states that her cancer is &quot;dormant.&quot; MEDICATIONS: 1. Hydrochlorothiazide. 2. Lisinopril. 3. Percocet. The patient states that the Percocet helps to take the edge of her pain, but does not completely eliminate it. SUBJECTIVE: The patient rates the pain at 2/10 on the pain analog scale. The patient states that with elevation and rest, her pain subsides. FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES/HOBBIES: Currently limited including basic household chores and activities, this does increases her pain. The patient states she also recently joined Weight Watchers and was involved in a walking routine and is currently unable to participate in this activity. WORK STATUS: The patient is currently on medical leave as a paraprofessional. The patient states that she works as a teacher's aide in the school system and is required to complete extensive walking and standing activities. The patient states that she is primarily on her feet while at work and rarely has a sitting break for extensive period of time. The patient's goal is to be able to stand and walk without pain. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a private home with children and her father. The patient states that she does have stairs to negotiate without the use of a railing. She states that she is able to manage the stairs, however, is very slow with her movement. The patient smokes 1-1/2 packs of cigarettes a day and does not have a history of regular exercise routine. OBJECTIVE: Upon observation, the patient is a very obese female who is ambulating with significant antalgic gait pattern and altered normal gait due to the pain as well as the walking boot. Upon inspection of the left ankle, it appears to have swelling, unsure if this swelling is secondary to injury or water retention as the patient states she has significant water retention. When compared to right ankle edema, it is approximately equal. There is no evidence of discoloration or temperature. The patient states that she had no bruising at the time of injury. Active range of motion of left ankle is as follows: Dorsiflexion is 6 degrees past neutral and plantar flexion is 54 degrees, eversion 20 degrees, and inversion is 30 degrees. Left ankle dorsiflexion lacks 10 degrees from neutral and plantar flexion is 36 degrees, this motion is very painful. The patient was tearful during this activity. Eversion is 3 degrees and inversion is 25 degrees. The patient states this movement was difficult, but not painful. Strength testing of the right lower extremity is grossly 4+-5/5 and left ankle is 2/5 as the patient is unable to obtain full range of motion. PALPATION: The patient is very tender to palpation primarily along the lateral malleolus of the left ankle. JOINT PLAY: Unable to be assessed secondary to the patient's extreme tenderness and guarding of the ankle joint. SPECIAL TESTS: A 6-minute walk test. The patient was able to ambulate approximately 600 feet while wearing her walking boot prior to her pain significantly increasing in the ankle and requiring the test to be stopped. ASSESSMENT: The patient would benefit from skilled physical therapy intervention as a trial of treatment in order to address the following problem list: 1. Increased pain. 2. Decreased range of motion. 3. Decreased strength. 4. Decreased ability to complete work task and functional activities in the home. 5. Decreased gait pattern. SHORT-TERM GOALS TO BE COMPLETED IN 3 WEEKS: 1. The patient will demonstrate independence with home exercise program. 2. The patient will ambulate without her boot for 48 hours in order to decrease reliance upon the boot for ankle stabilization. 3. The patient will achieve left ankle dorsiflexion to neutral and plantar flexion to 45 degrees without significant increase in pain. 4. The patient will demonstrate 3/5 strength of the left ankle. 5. The patient will tolerate the completion of the 6-minute walk test without the use of a boot with minimal increase in pain. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE COMPLETED IN 6 WEEKS: 1. The patient will report 0/10 pain in the 48-hour period without the use of medication and without wearing her boot. 2. The patient will return to go through the work without the use of the walking boot with report of minimal increase in pain and discomfort. PROGNOSIS: Fair for above-stated goals with full compliance to home exercise program and therapy treatment as well as the patient motivation. PLAN: The patient to be seen three times a week for 6 weeks for the following: 1. Therapeutic exercise with home exercise program in order to improve active range of motion and strength as functional activities. 2. Modalities to include ice and heat. 3. Manual therapy to include joint mobilization and soft tissue mobilization as tolerated. 4. Gait training in order to regain normal gait pattern and avoid any increase in additional joint involvement. I have explained the findings and the plan of care with the patient. The patient states she understands and agrees to comply with treatment and plan of care.",FALSE

Rates her pain in her knee as a 10/10. She does alternate ice and heat. She is using Tylenol No. 3 p.r.n. and ibuprofen OTC p.r.n. with minimal relief. ALLERGIES 1. PENICILLIN. 2. KEFLEX. 3. BACTRIM. 4. SULFA. 5. ACE BANDAGES. MEDICATIONS 1. Toprol. 2. Xanax. 3. Advair. 4. Ventolin. 5. Tylenol No. 3. 6. Advil. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Will be starting the Medifast diet, has discussed this with her PCP, who encouraged her to have gastric bypass, but the patient would like to try this Medifast diet first. Other than this, denies any further problems with her eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, nervous system, except what is noted above and below. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: Pulse 72, blood pressure 130/88, respirations 16, height 5 feet 6.5 inches. GENERAL: This is a 36-year-old white female who is A&O x3, in no apparent distress with a pleasant affect. She is well developed, well nourished, appears her stated age. EXTREMITIES: Orthopedic evaluation of the left knee reveals there to be well-healed portholes. She does have some medial joint line swelling. Negative ballottement. She has significant pain to palpation of the medial joint line, none of the lateral joint line. She has no pain to palpation on the popliteal fossa. Range of motion is approximately -5 degrees to 95 degrees of flexion. It should be noted that she has extreme hyperextension on the right with 95+ degrees of flexion on the right. She has a click with McMurray. Negative anterior-posterior drawer. No varus or valgus instability noted. Positive patellar grind test. Calf is soft and nontender. Gait is stable and antalgic on the left. ASSESSMENT 1. Osteochondral defect, torn meniscus, left knee. 2. Obesity. PLAN: I have encouraged the patient to work on weight reduction, as this will only benefit her knee. I did discuss treatment options at length with the patient, but I think the best plan for her would be to work on weight reduction. She questions whether she needs a total knee; I don't believe she needs total knee replacement. She may, however, at some point need an arthroscopy. I have encouraged her to start formal physical therapy and a home exercise program. Will use ice or heat p.r.n. I have given her refills on Tylenol No. 3, Flector patch, and Relafen not to be taken with any other anti-inflammatory. She does have some abdominal discomfort with the anti-inflammatories, was started on Nexium 20 mg one p.o. daily. She will follow up in our office in four weeks. If she has not gotten any relief with formal physical therapy and the above-noted treatments, we will discuss with Dr. X whether she would benefit from another knee arthroscopy. The patient shows a good understanding of this treatment plan and agrees.",FALSE

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was given intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis and thigh-high TED hoses were placed on the lower extremities while in the preanesthesia holding area. The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced. The head was placed on a well-padded head holder. The eyes and face were protected from pressure. A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis. The arms were tucked and draped to the sides. All bony prominences were well padded. An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision. The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery. The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided. The midline structures were reflected to the right side. Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected. The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally. An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7. The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection. Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery. The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally. At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely. Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space. All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6. The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints. The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur. Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs. The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies. Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete. A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression. Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment. The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings. The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment. In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling. The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter. Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone. The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space. The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis. The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces. There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7. A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position. Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling. An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis. The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6. Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures. The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws. An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts. Blood loss was minimal. The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics. The wound was inspected and judged to be dry. The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips. The sponge and needle count were correct. A sterile dressing was applied to the wound. The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis. The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Stenosing tendinosis, right thumb (trigger finger). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Stenosing tendinosis, right thumb (trigger finger). PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Release of A1 pulley, right thumb. ANESTHESIA: IV regional with sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOURNIQUET TIME: Approximately 20 minutes at 250 mmHg. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: There was noted to be thickening of the A1 pulley. There was a fibrous nodule noted within the flexor tendon of the thumb, which caused triggering sensation to the thumb. HISTORY: This is a 51-year-old right hand dominant female with a longstanding history of pain as well as locking sensation to her right thumb. She was actually able to spontaneously trigger the thumb. She was diagnosed with stenosing tendinosis and wishes to proceed with release of A1 pulley. All risks and benefits of the surgery was discussed with her at length. She was in agreement with the above treatment plan. PROCEDURE: On 08/21/03, she was taken to operating room at ABCD General Hospital and placed supine on the operating table. A regional anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesia Department. Tourniquet was placed on her proximal arm. The upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. An incision was made over the proximal crease of the thumb. Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery. The nerves were identified and retracted throughout the entire procedure. The fibers of the A1 pulley were identified. They were sharply dissected to release the tendon. The tendon was then pulled up into the wound and inspected. There was no evidence of gross tear noted. Fibrous nodule was noted within the tendon itself. There was no evidence of continuous locking. Once release of the pulley had been performed, the wound was copiously irrigated. It was then reapproximated using #5-0 nylon simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures. Sterile dressing was applied to the upper extremity. Tourniquet was deflated. It was noted that the thumb was warm and pink with good capillary refill. The patient was transferred to Recovery in apparent stable and satisfactory condition. Prognosis is fair.",FALSE
" FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Herniated nucleuses pulposus, C5-6 greater than C6-7, left greater than C4-5 right with left radiculopathy. 2. Moderate stenosis C5-6. OPERATION: On 06/25/07, anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-5, C5-6, C6-7 using Bengal cages and Slimlock plate C4 to C7; intraoperative x-ray. This is a 60-year-old white male who was in the office on 05/01/07 because of neck pain with left radiculopathy and &quot;tension headaches.&quot; In the last year or so, he has had more and more difficulty and more recently has developed tingling and numbness into the fingers of the left hand greater than right. He has some neck pain at times and has seen Dr. X for an epidural steroid injection, which was very helpful. More recently he saw Dr. Y and went through some physical therapy without much relief. Cervical MRI scan was obtained and revealed a large right-sided disc herniation at C4-5 with significant midline herniations at C5-6 and a large left HNP at C6-7. In view of the multiple levels of pathology, I was not confident that anything short of surgical intervention would give him significant relief. The procedure and its risk were fully discussed and he decided to proceed with the operation. HOSPITAL COURSE: Following admission, the procedure was carried out without difficulty. Blood loss was about 125 cc. Postop x-ray showed good alignment and positioning of the cages, plate, and screws. After surgery, he was able to slowly increase his activity level with assistance from physical therapy. He had some muscle spasm and soreness between the shoulder blades and into the back part of his neck. He also had some nausea with the PCA. He had a low-grade fever to 100.2 and was started on incentive spirometry. Over the next 12 hours, his fever resolved and he was able to start getting up and around much more easily. By 06/27/07, he was ready to go home. He has been counseled regarding wound care and has received a neck sheet for instruction. He will be seen in two weeks for wound check and for a followup evaluation/x-rays in about six weeks. He has prescriptions for Lortab 7.5 mg and Robaxin 750 mg. He is to call if there are any problems.",TRUE

Using blunt dissection the dorsal ulnar sensory nerve branches and radial sensory nerve branches were dissected and retracted out of the operative field. The extensor retinaculum was then incised and the extensor tendon was dissected and retracted out of the operative field. The ganglion was then further dissected to its origin from the dorsal distal scapholunate interosseus ligament and excised in toto. Care was taken to protect ligament integrity. Reactive synovium was then removed using soft tissue rongeur technique. The wound was then infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine. The tendons were allowed to resume their normal anatomical position. The skin was closed with 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Sterile dressings were applied. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Trimalleolar ankle fracture. 2. Dislocation right ankle. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Trimalleolar ankle fracture. 2. Dislocation right ankle. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Closed open reduction and internal fixation of right ankle. ANESTHESIA: Spinal with sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: 75 minutes at 325 mmHg. COMPONENTS: Synthes small fragment set was used including a 2.5 mm drill bed. A six hole one-third tibial plate, one 12 mm 3.5 mm cortical screw fully threaded and two 16 mm 3.5 mm cortical fully-threaded screws. There were two 20 mm 4.0 cancellous screws and one 18 mm 4.0 cancellous screw placed. There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed. GROSS FINDINGS: Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall. The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell. The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room. At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint. After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained. The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient. This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes. Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle. A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified. The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site. The wound was copiously irrigated and dried. Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position. There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone. It was held in place with reduction forceps. A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation. It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula. Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each. The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length. Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole. The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length. Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position. There was no lateralization of the joints. Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle. Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus. Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site. The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures. Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum. The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus. There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies. Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire. Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length. These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position. Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws. They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint. At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin. A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril. A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity. This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.",FALSE
" HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 18-year-old girl brought in by her father today for evaluation of a right knee injury. She states that approximately 3 days ago while playing tennis she had a non-contact injury in which she injured the right knee. She had immediate pain and swelling. At this time, she complains of pain and instability in the knee. The patient's past medical history is significant for having had an ACL injury to the knee in 2008. She underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by Dr. X at that time, subsequently in the same year she developed laxity of the graft due in part to noncompliance and subsequently, she sought attention from Dr. Y who performed a revision ACL reconstruction at the end of 2008. The patient states she rehabbed the knee well after that and did fine with good stability of the knee until this recent injury. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She claims no chronic illnesses. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 03/2008, and subsequently had a revision ACL reconstruction in 12/2008. She has also had arm surgery when she was 6 years old. MEDICATIONS: She takes no medications on a regular basis ALLERGIES: She is allergic to Keflex and has skin sensitivity to Steri-Strips. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is single. She is a full-time student at University. Uses no tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. She exercises weekly, mainly tennis and swelling. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Significant for recent weight gain, occasional skin rashes. The remainder of her systems negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION GENERAL: The patient is 4 foot 10 inches tall, weighs 110 pounds. EXTREMITIES: She ambulates with some difficulty with a marked limp on the right side. Inspection of the knee reveals a significant effusion in the knee. She has difficulty with passive range of motion of the knee secondary to pain. She does have tenderness to palpation at the medial joint line and has a positive Lachman's exam. NEUROVASCULAR: She is neurovascularly intact. IMPRESSION: Right knee injury suggestive of a recurrent anterior cruciate ligament tear, possible internal derangement. PLAN: The patient will be referred for an MRI of the right knee to evaluate the integrity of her revision ACL graft. In the meantime, she will continue to use ice as needed. Moderate her activities and use crutches. She will follow up as soon as the MRI is performed.",FALSE

HISTORY: This 51-year-old female presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself NPO since mid night for surgery on her painful right foot bunion, hammer toes, and Tailor's bunion. The patient has a long history of crippling severe rheumatoid arthritis. She has pain with shoe gear and pain with every step. She has tried multiple conservative measures under Dr. X's supervision consisting of wide shoe's and accommodative padding all which have provided inadequate relief. At this time, she desires attempted surgical reconstruction/correction. The consent is available on the chart for review and the risks versus benefits of this procedure have been discussed with patient in detail by Dr. X. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection. Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril. Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine were instilled into the right foot using a standard ankle block technique. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 230 mmHg. The foot was lowered in the operative field. The sterile stockinette was reflected and attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint. The joint was found to be severely contracted with lateral deviation of the hallux with a slightly overlapping contracted second toe. In addition, the range of motion was less than 5 degrees of the first ray. There was medial pinch callus and callus on the plantar right second metatarsal. Using a #10 blade, a linear incision over the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then created approximately 4 cm in length. Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue all which was found to be very thin taking care to protect the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon. Any small vein traversing the operative site were clamped with hemostat and ligated with electrocautery. Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined with sharp dissection. The joint capsule was then visualized. Two apparent soft tissue masses probably consistent with rheumatoid nodules were found at the distal medial aspect of the first metatarsal capsule. A dorsal linear incision to the capsular tissue down to bone was performed with a #15 blade. The capsule and periosteal tissues were elevated sharply off the metatarsal head and the base of proximal phalanx. A large amount of hypertrophic synovium was encountered over the metatarsophalangeal joint. In addition, multiple hypertrophic exostosis were found dorsally, medially, and laterally over the metatarsal. Upon entering the joint, the base of the proximal phalanx was grossly deformed and the medial and lateral aspect were widely flared and encompassing the metatarsal head. A sagittal saw was used to carefully remove the base of the proximal phalanx just distal to the metaphyseal flare. Next, the bone was passed out as specimen. The head of the metatarsal had evidence of erosion and eburnation. The tibial sesamoid was practically absent, but was found to be a conglomeration of hypertrophic synovium and poorly differentiated appearing exostosis and bony tissue. This was hindering the range of motion of the joint and was removed. The fibular sesamoid was in the interspace. A lateral release was performed in addition. Next, the McGlamry elevators were inserted into the first metatarsal head and all of the plantar adhesions were freed. The metatarsal head was remodeled with a sagittal saw and all of the medial eminence the dorsal and lateral hypertropic bone was removed and the metatarsal head was shaped into more acceptable contoured structure. Next, the Biopro sizer was used and it was found that a median large implant would be the best fit for this patient's joint. A small drill hole was made in the central aspect at the base of the proximal phalanx. The trial sizer median large was placed in the joint and an excellent fit and increased range of motion was observed. Next, the joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline. A median large porous Biopro implant was inserted using the standard technique and was tapped with the mallet into position. It had an excellent fit and the range of motion again was markedly increased from the preoperative level. Next, the wound was again flushed with copious amounts of saline. The flexor tendon was inspected and was found to be intact plantarly. A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsule in a running fashion. A medial capsulorrhaphy performed and the toe assumed to more rectus position and the joint was more congruous. Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion. Attention was directed to the right second toe, which was found to be markedly contracted and rigid in nature. There was a clavus in the dorsal aspect of the head of the proximal phalanx noted. A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx approximately 2 cm in length. The incision was deepened with #15 blade down to the subcutaneous tissue. Next, the medial and lateral aspects of the wound were undermined with sharp dissection taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Next, after identifying the extensor expansion and long extensor tendon, a #15 blade was used to transect the tendon at the level of the joint. The tendon was peeled off sharply, proximally, and distally. The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound. The bone was found to be extremely soft in the toe joints and the head of the proximal phalanx was oddly shaped and the cartilage was eroded. The base of the middle phalanx, however, had a normal-appearing cartilage. A sagittal saw was used to transect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare. Next, the base of the middle phalanx was also resected. A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was retrograded out at the end of the toe and then back through the residual proximal phalanx shaft. The toe assumed a straight and markedly increased straight position. An extensor hood resection was performed to assist in keeping the proximal phalanx plantar flexed. The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline. A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the tendon after arthrodesis. A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique. The wire was cut, capped, and bent in the usual fashion. Attention was directed to the right third toe where an exact same procedure as performed in the second digit was repeated. The same suture material was used and the same 0.045 Kirschner wire was used for external wire fixation. Attention was directed to the right fourth toe with exact same procedure was repeated. The same suture material was used. However, a 0.062 Kirschner wire was used to fixate the arthrodesis site as the bone was very soft and a 0.045 Kirschner wire was attempted but was found to be slipping in the soft bone and was inadequately holding the arthrodesis site tight. Next, attention was directed to the fifth digit, which was found to be contracted as well. A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx with a #10 blade approximately 2 cm in length. A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue down to the level of the long extensor tendon, which was identified and transected. The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were transected and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound. A sagittal saw was used to resect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare. The toe assumed to more rectus position. The reciprocating rasp was used to smooth the all bony surfaces. The joint was again flushed with saline. Next, the long extensor tendon was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. The skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a simple interrupted technique. Next, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head, which was found to have a lateral exostosis and bursa under the skin. A #10 blade was used to make a 2.5 cm dorsal incision over the fifth metatarsal head. The incision was deepened with a #15 blade to the subcutaneous tissue. Any small vein traversing subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery. Care was taken to avoid abductor digiti minimi tendon and extensor digitorum longus tendon respectively. Next, the dorsal linear capsular incision was made down to the bone with a #15 blade. The capsular and periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound. Hypertrophic bone was noted to be found dorsally and laterally as well as plantarly. A sagittal saw was used to resect all hypertrophic bone. A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces. Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of saline. The capsular and periosteal tissues wee closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. A bursa which was found consisting of a white glistening hypertrophic synovium was removed and sent as specimen as was also found in two of the second and third digit in the above procedures. The skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion. The ______ was reinforced with horizontal mattress sutures with #5-0 Monocryl. Attention was directed to the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint where the joint was found to be contracted and the proximal phalanx was still found to be elevated. Therefore, a #15 blade was used to make a stab incision over the joint lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tendon. The tendon was transected. Next, a blade was inserted in the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspects of the metatarsophalangeal joint and tenotomy was performed. Next, the proximal phalanx residual bone was plantar flexed and found to assume a more rectus position. One #4-0 nylon suture was placed in the skin. Mastisol tape was applied to the first metatarsal and fifth metatarsal postoperative wounds. Betadine-soaked Owen silk was applied to all wounds. Betadine-soaked 4 x 4 splints were applied to all toes. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits. All the wires have previously been bent and cut and all were capped. A standard postoperative consisting of 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. She was given prescription for Tylenol #3, #40 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn 375 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c. She is to continue her rheumatoid arthritis drugs preoperatively prescribed by the rheumatologist. She is to follow up with Dr. X in the office. She was given emergency contact numbers and standard postoperative instructions. She was given Darco OrthoWedge shoe and a pair of crutches. She was discharged in stable condition.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic plantar fasciitis, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic plantar fasciitis, right foot. PROCEDURE: Open plantar fasciotomy, right foot. ANESTHESIA: Local infiltrate with IV sedation. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems. The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative care despite multiple attempts at conservative care. The preoperative discussion with the patient including alternative treatment options, the procedure itself was explained, and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, continued pain, recurrence, falling arch, digital contracture, and the postoperative management were discussed. The patient has been advised, although no guarantee for success could be given, most of the patients have improved function and less pain. All questions were thoroughly answered. The patient requested for surgical repair since the problem has reached a point to interfere with normal daily activities. The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort. DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was given 1 g Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis 30 minutes prior to the procedure. The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. Following a light IV sedation, a posterior tibial nerve block and local infiltrate of the operative site was performed with 10 mL, and a 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, and 0.25% Marcaine was affected. The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Balance anesthesia was obtained. PROCEDURE: Plantar fasciotomy, right foot. The plantar medial tubercle of the calcaneus was palpated and a vertical oblique incision, 2 cm in length with the distal aspect overlying the calcaneal tubercle was affected. Blunt dissection was carried out to expose the deep fascia overlying the abductor hallucis muscle belly and the medial plantar fascial band. A periosteal elevator did advance laterally across the inferior aspect of the medial and central plantar fascial bands, creating a small and narrow soft tissue tunnel. Utilizing a Metzenbaum scissor, transection of the medial two-third of the plantar fascia band began at the junction of the deep fascia of the abductor hallucis muscle belly and medial plantar fascial band, extending to the lateral two-thirds of the band. The lateral plantar fascial band was left intact. Visualization and finger probe confirmed adequate transection. The surgical site was flushed with normal saline irrigation. The deep layer was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted with combination of 1 horizontal mattress and simples. The dressing consisted of Adaptic, 4 x 4, conforming bandages, and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression. The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well, and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact. A walker boot was dispensed and applied. The patient will be allowed to be full weightbearing to tolerance, in the boot to encourage physiological lengthening of the release of plantar fascial band. The next office visit will be in 4 days. The patient was given prescriptions for Keflex 500 mg 1 p.o. three times a day x10 days and Lortab 5 mg #40, 1 to 2 p.o. q.4-6 h. p.r.n. pain, 2 refills, along with written and oral home instructions. After a short recuperative period, the patient was discharged home with vital signs stable and in no acute distress.",FALSE
" PROCEDURE: Medial branch rhizotomy, lumbosacral. INFORMED CONSENT: The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient. The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks. The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications. I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids. The patient was informed both verbally and in writing. The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed. SEDATION: The patient was given conscious sedation and monitored throughout the procedure. Oxygenation was given. The patient's oxygenation and vital signs were closely followed to ensure the safety of the administration of the drugs. PROCEDURE: The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback. The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine. The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis. The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine. The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement. Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the spine and the planned needle approach. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine. With fluoroscopy, a Teflon coated needle, ***, was gently guided into the region of the Medial Branch nerves from the Dorsal Ramus of ***. Specifically, each needle tip was inserted to the bone at the groove between the transverse process and superior articular process on lumbar vertebra, or for sacral vertebrae at the lateral-superior border of the posterior sacral foramen. Needle localization was confirmed with AP and lateral radiographs. The following technique was used to confirm placement at the Medial Branch nerves. Sensory stimulation was applied to each level at 50 Hz; paresthesias were noted at *** volts. Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration; corresponding paraspinal muscle twitching without extremity movement was noted at *** volts. Following this, the needle Trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached. At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 1cc 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the Medial Branch nerve and surrounding tissue. After completion of each nerve block a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 85 degrees Celsius for 90 seconds. All injected medications were preservative free. Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure. COMPLICATIONS: None. No complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition. DISCUSSION: Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable. The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day. The patient was told to resume all medications. The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function. Follow up appointment was made in approximately 1 week.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Erythema of the right knee and leg, possible septic knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Erythema of the right knee superficial and leg, right septic knee ruled out. INDICATIONS: Mr. ABC is a 52-year-old male who has had approximately eight days of erythema over his knee. He has been to multiple institutions as an outpatient for this complaint. He has had what appears to be prepatellar bursa aspirated with little to no success. He has been treated with Kefzol and 1 g of Rocephin one point. He also reports, in the emergency department today, an attempt was made to aspirate his actual knee joint which was unsuccessful. Orthopedic Surgery was consulted at this time. Considering the patient's physical exam, there is a portal that would prove to be outside of the erythema that would be useful for aspiration of the knee. After discussion of risks and benefits, the patient elected to proceed with aspiration through the anterolateral portal of his knee joint. PROCEDURE: The patient's right anterolateral knee area was prepped with Betadine times two and a 20-gauge spinal needle was used to approach the knee joint approximately 3 cm anterior and 2 cm lateral to the superolateral pole of the patella. The 20-gauge spinal needle was inserted and entered the knee joint. Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid was aspirated. The patient tolerated the procedure well. DISPOSITION: Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint. We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, as well as culture and Gram stain. We will follow these results. After discussion with the emergency department staff, it appears that they tend to try to treat his erythema which appears to be cellulitis with IV antibiotics.",FALSE
" CC: Weakness. HX: This 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. MEDS: none. PMH: see above. FHX: Father with Von Hippel-Lindau Disease.

By 11/14/95, he required NGT feeding due to dysphagia and aspiration risk confirmed on cookie swallow studies.MRI Brain, 2/19/96, revealed several lesions (hemangioblastoma) in the cerebellum and brain stem. There were postoperative changes and a cyst in the medulla. On 10/25/96, he presented with a 1.5 week h/o numbness in BLE from the mid- thighs to his toes, and worsening BLE weakness. He developed decubitus ulcers on his buttocks. He also had had intermittent urinary retention for month, chronic SOB and dysphagia. He had been sitting all day long as he could not move well and had no daytime assistance. His exam findings were consistent with his complaints. He had had no episodes of diaphoresis, headache, or elevated blood pressures. An MRI of the C-T spine, 10/26/96, revealed a prominent cervicothoracic syrinx extending down to T10. There was evidence of prior cervical laminectomy of C6-T1 with expansion of the cord in the thecalsac at that region. Multiple intradural extra spinal nodular lesions (hyperintense on T2, isointense on T1, enhanced gadolinium) were seen in the cervical spine and cisterna magna. The largest of which measures 1.1 x 1.0 x 2.0cm. There are also several large ring enhancing lesions in cerebellum. The lesions were felt to be consistent with hemangioblastoma. No surgical or medical intervention was initiated. Visiting nursing was provided. He has since been followed by his local physician",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: 1. Left endoscopic carpal tunnel release. 2. Endotracheal fasciotomy. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATION: The patient is a 62-year-old lady with the aforementioned diagnosis refractory to nonoperative management. All risks and benefits were explained. Questions answered. Options discussed. No guarantees were made. She wished to proceed with surgery. PROCEDURE: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion, the arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I made a transverse incision one fingerbreadth proximal to the distal volar wrist crease. Dissection was carried down to the antebrachial fascia, which was cut in a distally based fashion. Bipolar electrocautery was used to maintain meticulous hemostasis. I then performed an antebrachial fasciotomy proximally. I entered the extra bursal space deep into the transverse carpal ligament and used the spatula probe and then the dilators and then the square probe to enlarge the area. Great care was taken to feel the washboard undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate on the ulnar side. Great care was taken with placement. A good plane was positively identified. I then placed the endoscope in and definitely saw the transverse striations of the deep surface of the transverse carpal ligament. Again, I felt the hook of the hamate ulnar to me. I had my thumb on the distal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament. I then partially deployed the blade, and starting 1 mm from the distal edge, the transverse carpal ligament was positively identified. I pulled back and cut and partially tightened the transverse carpal ligament. I then feathered through the distal ligament and performed a full-thickness incision through the distal half of the ligament. I then checked to make sure this was properly performed and then cut the proximal aspect. I then entered the carpal tunnel again and saw that the release was complete, meaning that the cut surfaces of the transverse carpal ligament were separated; and with the scope rotated, I could see only one in the field at a time. Great care was taken and at no point was there any longitudinal structure cut. Under direct vision through the incision, I made sure that the distal antebrachial fascia was cut. Following this, I irrigated and closed the skin. The patient was dressed and sent to the recovery room in good condition.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Scarf bunionectomy procedure of the first metatarsal of the left foot. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with local. HISTORY: This patient is a 55-year-old female who presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery for her painful left bunion. The patient has had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoes. The patient has failed to conservative treatment and desires surgical correction at this time. Risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail by Dr. X, and consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After an IV established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously. The patient was then taken to the Operating Suite via cart and was placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for protection. Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over her left ankle with copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection. After adequate IV sedation was applied, the patient was given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 4.5 cc 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1.0 cc of Solu-Medrol mixture in the standard Mayo block to the left foot. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was then elevated, the Esmarch was applied and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was then lowered to the operating field. A sterile stockinet was reflected and the attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot. After sufficient anesthesia, using a #10 blade a linear incision was made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally, just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon. Then using a fresh #15 blade, this incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing veins were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery. A neurovascular bundle was identified and reflected medially. Laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and protected with retraction as well. Care was then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margins of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully. The first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule was then identified and using a #15 blade, a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule. The periosteum was reflected and elevated off of its bone and the metatarsal head as well as the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree. Noted was a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head as well as some small osteophytes along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx. Care was then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint. The bone cortex was noted to be intact and in good condition. Following this, using a sagittal saw with a #138 blade, the attention was directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head. In the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial, the medial eminence of bone was resected. Plantarly it was noted that the tibial sesamoid groove was intact and the sesamoid apparatus was intact as well. Following this bone cut, 0.45 K-wire was inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head. Then using the Reese osteotomy guide, the guide was directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal. A second 0.45 K-wire was inserted proximally as well. Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral. After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made. This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal. Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone. Following this, the distal portion of the osteotomy cut was freely movable and was able to be translocated medially. The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone. Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction. Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit. The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex. Then using 2.7 mm tap, the thread holes were placed and using an 18 x 2.7 mm screw ___________ was achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved. Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut. Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked. Following this, the holes were measured, found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole was tapped using a 2.7 mm tap. Following this, a 20 mm full threaded screw was inserted and tightened. Good intramedullary sludge was noted and compression was achieved. Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite. Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted. Based on this, a lateral release was performed. The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace. The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected. Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament. Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment. The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline. After this, attention was directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed and the capsule was closed using #3-0 Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous tissues were closed using #3-0 and #4-0 Vicryl sutures to close in layers. The skin was then reapproximated and closed using #5-0 Monocryl suture. Following this, the incisions were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Kerlix as well as Coban dressing. The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minutes at 250 mmHg. The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot. The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. Following this, the patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen total #20 to be taken one every six hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain. The patient was also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four times a day. The patient was given surgical shoe and was placed in a posterior sling. The patient was given crutches and instructed to use them for ambulation. The patient was instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend. The patient will follow up with Dr. X on Tuesday morning at 11'o clock in his Livonia office. The patient was concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and was placed on codeine and antibiotics due to that. The patient has Dr. X's pager and will contact him over this weekend if she has any problems or complaints or return to Emergency Department if any difficulty should arise. X-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home upon completion of this.",FALSE

COMPLICATIONS: None. PATIENT STATUS: Taken to recovery room in stable condition. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 36-year-old female who has had severe, recalcitrant right upper extremity pain, numbness, tingling, shoulder pain, axial neck pain, and headaches for many months. Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested. We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options. Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed. She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery. Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively. SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite. General anesthetic was administered. The patient was placed in the supine position. All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated. The patient was noted to have pulse in this position. Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision. Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed. The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease. Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected. Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally. This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split. Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels. Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures. Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur. A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc. Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally. Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace. High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion. Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura. No further evidence of compression was identified. Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam. Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently. Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set. An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit. This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit. The graft was stable to pull-out forces. Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws. Plate and screws were then locked to the plate. Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft. Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline. Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl. Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma. Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin. A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure. The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications. All needle and sponge counts were correct. Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Sacro-iliitis (720.2), lumbo-sacral segmental dysfunction (739.3), thoraco-lumbar segmental dysfunction (739.2), associated with myalgia/fibromyositis (729.1). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Sacro-iliitis (720.2), lumbo-sacral segmental dysfunction (739.3), thoraco-lumbar segmental dysfunction (739.2), associated with myalgia/fibromyositis (729.1). ANESTHESIA: Conscious Sedation. INFORMED CONSENT: After adequate explanation of the medical surgical and procedural options, this patient has decided to proceed with the recommended spinal Manipulation under Anesthesia (MUA). The patient has been informed that more than one procedure may be necessary to achieve the satisfactory results. INDICATION: This patient has failed extended conservative care of condition/dysfunction by means of aggressive physical medical and pharmacological intervention. COMMENTS: This patient understands the essence of the diagnosis and the reasons for the MUA- The associated risks of the procedure, including anesthesia complications, fracture, vascular accidents, disc herniation and post-procedure discomfort, were thoroughly discussed with the patient. Alternatives to the procedure, including the course of the condition without MUA, were discussed. The patient understands the chances of success from undergoing MUA and that no guarantees are made or implied regarding outcome. The patient has given both verbal and written informed consent for the listed procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was draped in the appropriate gowning and accompanied to the operative area. Following their sacral block injection, they were asked to lie supine on the operative table and they were placed on the appropriate monitors for this procedure. When the patient and I were ready, the anesthesiologist administered the appropriate medications to assist the patient into the twilight sedation using medication which allows the stretching, mobilization, and adjustments necessary for the completion of the outcome I desired. THORACIC SPINE: With the patient in the supine position on the operative table, the upper extremities were flexed at the elbow and crossed over the patient's chest to achieve maximum traction to the patient's thoracic spine. The first assistant held the patient's arms in the proper position and assisted in rolling the patient for the adjusting procedure. With the help of the first assist, the patient was rolled to their right side, selection was made for the contact point and the patient was rolled back over the doctor's hand. The elastic barrier of resistance was found, and a low velocity thrust was achieved using a specific closed reduction anterior to posterior/superior manipulative procedure. The procedure was completed at the level of TI-TI2. Cavitation was achieved. LUMBAR SPINE/SACRO-ILIAC JOINTS: With the patient supine on the procedure table, the primary physician addressed the patient's lower extremities which were elevated alternatively in a straight leg raising manner to approximately 90 degrees from the horizontal. Linear force was used to increase the hip flexion gradually during this maneuver. Simultaneously, the first assist physician applied a myofascial release technique to the calf and posterior thigh musculature. Each lower extremity was independently bent at the knee and tractioned cephalad in a neutral sagittal plane, lateral oblique cephalad traction, and medial oblique cephalad traction maneuver. The primary physician then approximated the opposite single knee from his position from neutral to medial slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. (a piriformis myofascial release was accomplished at this time). This was repeated with the opposite lower extremity. Following this, a Patrick-Fabere maneuver was performed up to and slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. With the assisting physician stabling the pelvis and femoral head (as necessary), the primary physician extended the right lower extremity in the sagittal plane, and while applying controlled traction gradually stretched the para-articular holding elements of the right hip by means gradually describing an approximately 30-35 degree horizontal arc. The lower extremity was then tractioned, and straight caudal and internal rotation was accomplished. Using traction, the lower extremity was gradually stretched into a horizontal arch to approximately 30 degrees. This procedure was then repeated using external rotation to stretch the para-articular holding elements of the hips bilaterally. These procedures were then repeated on the opposite lower extremity. By approximating the patient's knees to the abdomen in a knee-chest fashion (ankles crossed), the lumbo-pelvic musculature was stretched in the sagittal plane, by both the primary and first assist, contacting the base of the sacrum and raising the lower torso cephalad, resulting in passive flexion of the entire lumbar spine and its holding elements beyond the elastic barrier of resistance With the patient's lower extremities kept in hip/knee flexion,, the patient's torso was secured by the first assistant and the lumbar fascia/musculature elongated obliquely to the right and midline, in a controlled manner up to and beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. Cavitation was noted. This was repeated on the opposite side by the first assist. With the use of the undersheets, the patient was carefully placed in the decubitus position (right side down) and positioned so that the lumbar spine overlay the kidney plate to the point where the lumbar spine attained the horizontal and was derotated to avoid facet imbrication. The patient's body was stabilized in the extended position by the first assist. Segmental localization of the appropriate lumbar motion units was made by the primary physician and the elastic barrier of resistance found. A low velocity impulse thrust was applied achieving cavitation. .The sacro-iliac joint was then adjusted in the same position as above. The procedure was repeated on the opposite side by the first assist. The patient was then repositioned supine by means of the undersheet. With appropriate assistance, the patient was transferred from the procedure table to the gurney and was returned to the recovery room, where appropriate monitoring equipment was utilized to monitor vital signs. The IV was maintained to the point where the patient was fully alert and stable, and the patient was then transferred to a sitting recovery position and was given fluids and a light snack. Following this, the patient was discharged with appropriate home and rehabilitation instructions. COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no untoward incident or complication.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Osteoarthritis, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Osteoarthritis, right knee. PROCEDURE: Right total knee arthroplasty. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the Operating Room and after the successful placement of an epidural, as well as general anesthesia, administration 1 gm of Ancef preoperatively, the patient's right thigh, knee and leg were scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg. A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component. At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially. A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert. This gave good stability and a full range of motion. The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component was drilled for. A further trial reduction was done and two liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement was hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill holes were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone was somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate was secured and the patella was inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement was removed. At this point the tibial baseplate was locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly. The knee was extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minutes until the cement was cured. Further extraneous cement was removed. The pneumatic tourniquet was released, hemostasis was obtained with electrocoagulation. Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples. A sterile, bulky compression dressing was placed. The patient was stable on operative release.",TRUE

There are minimal degenerative changes noted in the joint. There is, however, the suggestion of an exostosis on the superior femoral neck, which could be consistent with femoroacetabular impingement. IMPRESSION: Bilateral hip pain, right worse than left, possibly suggesting femoroacetabular impingement based on x-rays and her clinical picture is also consistent with possible labral tear. PLAN: After discussing possible diagnoses with the patient, I have recommended that we get MRI arthrograms of the bilateral hips to evaluate the anatomy and especially concentrating on the labrum in the right hip. We will get that done as soon as possible. In the meantime, she is asked to moderate her activities. She will follow up as soon as the MRIs are performed.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Left supracondylar, intercondylar distal femur fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Left supracondylar, intercondylar distal femur fracture. PROCEDURE: Open reduction internal fixation of the left supracondylar, intercondylar distal femur fracture (27513). OPERATIVE FINDINGS: He had intercondylar split, and then he had a medial Hoffa fracture. He also had some comminution of the medial femoral condyle which prohibited an anatomic key between the two segments of the medial condyle. IMPLANTS: We used 2.4 and 3.5 cortical screws, as well as a LISS Synthes femoral locking plate. COMPLICATIONS: None. IV FLUIDS: 2000 ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 40 mL URINE OUTPUT: 650 HISTORY: This 45-year-old male had a ground-level fall, sustaining this injury. He was admitted for definitive operative fixation. Risks and benefits were discussed, he agreed to go ahead with the procedure. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The patient was identified in preop holding, then taken to the operating room. Once adequate anesthesia was obtained, his left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. He was given antibiotics. He placed a traction pin through his proximal tibia, and pulled weight off the end of the bed. I made a midline approach and then did the lateral parapatellar arthrotomy. We excised some of the fat pad to give us better visibility into the notch. We excised a good bit of his synovium and synovial pouch. At this time we were able to identify the fracture fragments. Again, there was an intercondylar split and then two free pieces of the medial condyle. The femur fracture was very distal through the metaphysis. At this time we thoroughly cleaned out all the clot between all the fracture fragments and cleaned the cortical margins. Next we began the reduction. There was no reduction key between the two segments of the Hoffa fracture. Therefore, we reduced the anterior portion of the medial condyle to the lateral condyle, held it with point-of-reduction clamp and K-wires, and then secured it with 2.4 mini fragment lag screws. Next, with this medial anterior piece in place, we had some contour over the notch with which we were able to reduce the posterior medial Hoffa fragment. This gave us a nice notch contour. Again, there was some comminution laterally so that the fracture between the Hoffa segments did not have a perfect key. Once we had it reduced, based on the notch reduction, we then held it with K-wires. We secured it with two 3.5 cortical screws from the lateral condyle into this posterior segment. We then secured it with 2.4 cortical screws from the anterior medial to the posterior medial segment just subchondral. Then, finally, we secured it with a 3.5 cortical screw from the anterior medial to the posterior medial piece. All screws ran between and out of the notch. With the condyle now well reduced, we reduced it to the metaphysis. We slid a 13-hole LISS plate submuscularly. We checked on AP and lateral views that showed we had good reduction of the fracture and appropriate plate placement. We placed the tip threaded guidewire through the A-hole of the plate jig and got it parallel to the joint. We then clamped the plate down to the bone. Proximally, we made a stab incision for the trocar at the 13-hole position, placed our tip threaded guidewire in the lateral aspect of the femur, checked it on lateral view, and had it in good position. With the jig in appropriate position and clamped, we then proceeded to fill the distal locking screws to get purchase into the condyles. We then placed multiple unicortical locking screws in the shaft and metaphyseal segment. Our most proximal screw was proximal to the tip of the prosthesis. At this time we took the jig off and put the final screw into the A-hole of the plate. We then took final C-arm views which showed we had a good reduction on AP and lateral views, the plate was in good position, we had full range of motion of the knee, and good reduction clinically and radiographically. We then pulse lavaged the knee with 3 liters of fluid. We closed the quad tendon and lateral retinaculum with interrupted 0 Vicryl over a Hemovac drain. Subdermal tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, skin with staples. Sterile dressing and a hinged knee brace were applied. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to Recovery in stable condition. PLAN: 1. Nonweightbearing for 3 months. 2. CPM for 0 to 90 degrees as tolerated.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4. 2. Enlarged dorsal root ganglia of the left L3 nerve root. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Transpedicular decompression of the left L3-L4 with discectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. SPECIMEN: None. HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old female with a four-month history of left thigh pain. An MRI of the lumbar spine has demonstrated a mass in the left L3 foramen displacing the nerve root, which appears to be a foraminal disc herniation effacing the L3 nerve root. Upon exploration of the nerve root, it appears that there was a small disc herniation in the foramen, but more impressive was the abnormal size of the dorsal root ganglia that was enlarged more medially than laterally. There was no erosion into the bone surrounding the area rather in the pedicle above or below or into the vertebral body, so otherwise the surrounding anatomy is normal. I was prepared to do a discectomy and had not consented the patient for a biopsy of the nerve root. But because of the sequela of cutting into a nerve root with residual weakness and persistent pain that the patient would suffer, at this point I was not able to perform this biopsy without prior consent from the patient. So, surgery ended decompressing the L3 foramen and providing a discectomy with idea that we will obtain contrasted MRIs in the near future and I will discuss the findings with the patient and make further recommendations. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital in a gurney. Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic. Endotracheal intubation followed. The patient received the Foley catheter. She was then placed in a prone position on a Jackson table. Bony prominences were well padded. Localizing x-rays were obtained at this time and the back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline incision was made over the L3-L4 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissues sharply, dissection was then carried out to the left of the midline with lumbodorsal fascia incised and the musculature was elevated in a supraperiosteal fashion from the level of L3. Retractors were placed into the wound to retract the musculature. At this point, the pars interarticularis was identified and the facet joint of L2-L3 was identified. A marker was placed over the pedicle of L3 and confirmed radiographically. Next, a microscope was brought onto the field. The remainder of the procedure was noted with microscopic visualization. A high-speed drill was used to remove the small portions of the lateral aspects of the pars interarticularis. At this point, soft tissue was removed with a Kerrison rongeur and the nerve root was clearly identified in the foramen. As the disc space of L3-L4 is identified, there is a small prominence of the disc, but not as impressive as I would expect on the MRI. A discectomy was performed at this time removing only small portions of the lateral aspect of the disc. Next, the nerve root was clearly dissected out and visualized, the lateral aspect of the nerve root appears to be normal in structural appearance. The medial aspect with the axilla of the nerve root appears to be enlarged. The color of the tissue was consistent with a nerve root tissue. There was no identifiable plane and this is a gentle enlargement of the nerve root. There are no circumscribed lesions or masses that can easily be separated from the nerve root. As I described in the initial paragraph, since I was not prepared to perform a biopsy on the nerve and the patient had not been consented, I do not think it is reasonable to take the patient to this procedure, because she will have persistent weakness and pain in the leg following this procedure. So, at this point there is no further decompression. A nerve fork was passed both ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there was no compression for lateral. The pedicle was palpated inferiorly and medially and there was no compression, as the nerve root can be easily moved medially. The wound was then irrigated copiously and suctioned dry. A concoction of Duramorph and ______ was then placed over the nerve root for pain control. The retractors were removed at this point. The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissues with #2 Vicryl sutures, and Steri-Strips covering the incision. The patient transferred to the hospital gurney, extubated by Anesthesia, and subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.",FALSE
" PROCEDURE: Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve. Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve. Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected. Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized. Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly. The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass. Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve. A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures. Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound. The elbow was dressed and splinted. The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right pectoralis major tendon rupture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right pectoralis major tendon rupture. OPERATION PERFORMED: Open repair of right pectoralis major tendon. ANESTHESIA: General with an interscalene block. COMPLICATIONS: None. Needle and sponge counts were done and correct. INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 26-year-old right hand dominant male who works in sales, who was performing heavy bench press exercises when he felt a tearing burning pain severe in his right shoulder. The patient presented with mild bruising over the proximal arm of the right side with x-ray showing no fracture. Over concerns for pectoralis tendon tear, he was sent for MRI evaluation where a complete rupture of a portion of the pectoralis major tendon was noted. Due to the patient's young age and active lifestyle surgical treatment was recommended in order to obtain best result. The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient including, but not limited to scarring, infection, damage to blood vessels and nerves, re-rupture, need further surgery, loss of range of motion, inability to return to heavy activity such as weight lifting, complex usual pain syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis as well as anesthetic risks. Understanding all risks and benefits, the patient desires to proceed with surgery as planned. FINDINGS: 1. Following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder, the pectoralis major tendon was encountered. The clavicular head was noted to be intact. There was noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an oblique-type tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion. 2. Following freeing of adhesions using tracks and sutures, the pectoralis major tendon was able to reapproximated to its insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps. 3. A soft tissue repair was performed with #5 FiberWire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site. Following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor, there was noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edges and a solid repair. OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: The patient was identified in the preop holding area. His right shoulder was identified, marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient. He was then taken to the operating room where he was transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team. He then received prophylactic antibiotics. A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, surgery performed, administration of antibiotics, and the availability of equipment. At this point, the patient was placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure points were padded and there was no pressure over the eyes. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Preoperative markings were still visible at this point. A deltopectoral incision was made utilizing the inferior portion. Dissection was carried down. The deltoid was retracted laterally. The clavicular head of the pectoralis major was noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion. There was a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head. Gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion, traction sutures of #5 Ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion. This allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump. At this point, a repair using #5 FiberWire was then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edges and no gapping of the repair site. At this point, a single metal suture anchor was attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site; however, the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone. For this reason, the starting hole was tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed, doubly loaded. The sutures were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified Krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair. At this point, there was noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue ends and a solid repair to gentle manipulation. Aggressive external rotation was not performed. The wound was then copiously irrigated. The cephalic vein was not injured during the case. The skin was then closed using a 2-0 Vicryl followed by a 3-0 subcuticular Prolene suture with Steri-Strips. Sterile dressing was then placed. Anesthesia was then performed, interscalene block. The patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotated. Plan for this patient, the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 days. We will then start a gentle Codman type exercises and having limited motion until the 4-6 week point based on the patient's progression.",TRUE

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6, greater than C6-C7 and C4-C5 with left radiculopathy. 2. Cervical stenosis with cord compression, C5-C6 (723.0), with surgical findings confirmed. PROCEDURES: 1. Anterior cervical discectomy at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 for neural decompression (63075, 63076, 63076). 2. Anterior interbody fusion at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 (22554, 22585, 22585) utilizing Bengal cages times three (22851). 3. Anterior instrumentation for stabilization by Slim-LOC plate C4, C5, C6, and C7 (22846); with intraoperative x-ray times two. ANESTHESIA: General. SERVICE: Neurosurgery. OPERATION: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in a supine position where general anesthesia was administered. Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces. Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner. Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided. The most prominent osteophyte and compression was at C5-C6 followed by C6-C7 and C4-C5 with a complete decompression of the spinal canal allowing the dura to finally bulge into the interspace at all three levels, once the ligaments were proximally removed as well and similarly a sign of a decompressed status. The nerve roots themselves were inspected with a double ball dissector and found to be equally decompressed. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently irrigated away. Appropriate size Bengal cages were filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position, filled along with fusion putty, and once these were quite tightly applied and checked, further stability was added by the placement of a Slim-LOC plate of appropriate size with appropriate size screws, and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and inspected, and hemostasis was completely achieved and finally the wound was closed in a routine closure by approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was sterilely dressed, and incorporated a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in a routine fashion. At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type.",TRUE
" Mr. XYZ is a 63-year-old right-handed white male who has been referred by the legal firm of ABCD Inc. for evaluation and ongoing pain management. The patient has been under the care of Dr. A for a number of years and for insurance purposes, is now to be transferred to our practice. There have been no issues with Dr. A and the patient has been quite content about his treatment. There are no drug related issues according to the few notes that I have from Dr. A's office and the patient is not a candidate for any further surgery. Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice. For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient. The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire. To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998. At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck. The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer. He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1. The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember. He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005. At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles. Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital. He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2. This was done on 12/15/2005. Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot. He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg. The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily. The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required. He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal. The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center. At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression. There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors. It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications. Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes. Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations. He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes. The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis. This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist. It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking. Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs. Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings. His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls. It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time. In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program. The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record. Evaluation was done by Dr. B. At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco. These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks. The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain. He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited. He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while. ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero. The patient denies smoking at this time. He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use. He obtains no pain medications from no other sources. Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly. There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient does not know what medications he is taking for diabetes and denies any diabetes. CABG in July of 2006 with no preoperative angina, shortness of breath, or myocardial infarction. History of depression, lumbar fusion surgery in 2000, left knee surgery 25 years ago. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is on disability. He does not smoke. He does not drink alcohol. He is single. He lives with a girlfriend. He has minimal activities of daily living. The patient cannot recollect when last a urine drug screen was done. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fevers, no headaches, chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, or change in appetite. Depressive symptoms of crying and decreased self-worth have been noted in the past.

Musculoskeletal: The patient's gait is markedly antalgic with predominant weightbearing on the left leg. There is marked postural deviation to the left. Because of pain, the patient is unable to heel-toe or tandem gait. Examination of the neck and cervical spine are within normal limits. Range of motion of the elbow, shoulders are within normal limits. No muscle spasm or abnormal muscle movements noted in the neck and upper extremities. Head is normocephalic. Examination of the anterior neck is within normal limits. There is significant muscle wasting of the quadriceps and hamstrings on the left, as well as of the calf muscles. Skin is normal. Hair distribution normal. Skin temperature normal in both the upper and lower extremities. The lumbar spine curvature is markedly flattened. There is a well-healed central scar extending from T12 to L1. The patient exhibits numerous positive Waddell's signs on exam of the low back with inappropriate flinching and wincing with even the lightest touch on the paraspinal muscles. Examination of the paraspinal muscles show a mild to moderate degree of spasm with a significant degree of tenderness and guarding, worse on the left than the right. Range of motion testing of the lumbar spine is labored in all directions. It is interesting that the patient cannot flex more than 5 in the standing position, but is able to sit without any problem. There is a marked degree of sciatic notch tenderness on the left. No abnormal muscle spasms or muscle movements were noted. Patrick's test is negative bilaterally. There are no provocative facetal signs in either the left or right quadrants of the lumbar area. Neurological exam: Cranial nerves II through XII are within normal limits. Neurological exam of the upper extremities is within normal limits with good motor strength and normal biceps, triceps and brachioradialis reflexes. Neurological exam of the lower extremities shows a 2+ right patellar reflex and -1 on the left. There is no ankle clonus. Babinski is negative. Sensory testing shows a minimal degree of sensory loss on the right L5 distribution. Muscle testing shows decreased L4-L5 on the left with extensor hallucis longus +2/5. Ankle extensors are -3 on the left and +5 on the right. Dorsiflexors of the left ankle are +2 on the left and +5 on the right. Straight leg raising test is positive on the left at about 35 . There is no ankle clonus. Hoffman's test and Tinel's test are normal in the upper extremities. Respiratory: Breath sounds normal. Trachea is midline. Cardiovascular: Heart sounds normal. No gallops or murmurs heard. Carotid pulses present. No carotid bruits. Peripheral pulses are palpable. Abdomen: Hernia site is intact. No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No areas of tenderness or guarding. IMPRESSION: 1. Post-laminectomy low back syndrome. 2. Left L5-S1 radiculopathy. 3. Severe cognitive impairment with minimal ***** for rehabilitation or return to work. 4. Opioid dependence for pain control. TREATMENT PLAN: The patient will continue on with his medications prescribed by Dr. Chang and I will see him in two weeks' time and probably suggest switching over from OxyContin to methadone. I do not think this patient is a good candidate for spinal cord stimulation due to his grasp of exactly what is happening and his cognitive impairment. I will get a behavioral evaluation from Mr. Tom Welbeck and refer the patient for ongoing physical therapy. The prognosis here for any improvement or return to work is zero.",FALSE
" CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left foot pain. HISTORY: XYZ is a basketball player for University of Houston who sustained an injury the day prior. They were traveling. He came down on another player's foot sustaining what he describes as an inversion injury. Swelling and pain onset immediately. He was taped but was able to continue playing He was examined by John Houston, the trainer, and had tenderness around the navicular so was asked to come over and see me for evaluation. He has been in a walking boot. He has been taped firmly. Pain with weightbearing activities. He is limping a bit. No significant foot injuries in the past. Most of his pain is located around the dorsal aspect of the hindfoot and midfoot. PHYSICAL EXAM: He does have some swelling from the hindfoot out toward the midfoot. His arch is maintained. His motion at the ankle and subtalar joints is preserved. Forefoot motion is intact. He has pain with adduction and abduction across the hindfoot. Most of this discomfort is laterally. His motor strength is grossly intact. His sensation is intact, and his pulses are palpable and strong. His ankle is not tender. He has minimal to no tenderness over the ATFL. He has no medial tenderness along the deltoid or the medial malleolus. His anterior drawer is solid. His external rotation stress is not painful at the ankle. His tarsometatarsal joints, specifically 1, 2 and 3, are nontender. His maximal tenderness is located laterally along the calcaneocuboid joint and along the anterior process of the calcaneus. Some tenderness over the dorsolateral side of the talonavicular joint as well. The medial talonavicular joint is not tender. RADIOGRAPHS: Those done of his foot weightbearing show some changes over the dorsal aspect of the navicular that appear chronic. I don't see a definite fracture. The tarsometarsal joints are anatomically aligned. Radiographs of his ankle again show changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint but no other fractures identified. Review of an MR scan of the ankle dated 12/01/05 shows what looks like some changes along the lateral side of the calcaneocuboid joint with disruption of the lateral ligament and capsular area. Also some changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint. I don't see any significant marrow edema or definitive fracture line. IMPRESSION: Left Chopart joint sprain. PLAN: I have spoken to XYZ about this. Continue with ice and boot for weightbearing activities. We will start him on a functional rehab program and progress him back to activities when his symptoms allow. He is clear on the prolonged duration of recovery for these hindfoot type injuries.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ruptured distal biceps tendon, right elbow. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ruptured distal biceps tendon, right elbow. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of distal biceps tendon, right elbow. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR, Room #2 and administered a general anesthetic. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A sterile tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity. The extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. Tourniquet time was 74 minutes. A curvilinear incision was made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin. Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery. Subcutaneous fat was separated and the skin flaps elevated. The _________ was identified. It was incised. The finger was placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon was found. There was some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture. This area was suctioned clean. The biceps tendon ends were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface. At this point, the #2 fiber wire was then passed through the tendon. Two fiber wires were utilized in a Krackow-type suture. Once this was completed, dissection was taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously. The radial tuberosity was palpated. Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and was used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow. A skin incision was made over this area. Approximately two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split. A stat was then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa. The tails of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision. At this point, they were placed to the side. Attention was directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated. The tuberosity came into view. The margins were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection. Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high was placed in the radial tuberosity. Three small drill holes were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture. The area was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution. A #4-0 pullout wire was utilized to pass the sutures through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole. The elbow was flexed and the tendon was then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated. The suture was tied over the bone islands. Both wounds were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. Muscle fascia was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture on the lateral incision followed by closure of the skin with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and small staples. The anterior incision was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl for Subq. and then skin was approximated with small staples. Both wounds were infiltrated with a total of 30 cc of 0.25% Marcaine solution for postop analgesia. A bulky fluff dressing was applied to the elbow, followed by application of a long-arm plaster splint maintaining the forearm in the supinated position. Tourniquet was inflated prior to application of the splint. Circulatory status returned to the extremity immediately. The patient was awakened. He was rather boisterous during his awakening, but care was taken to protect the right upper extremity. He was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.",FALSE
" PROCEDURE: Total hip replacement. PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table. An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter. Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues. The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally. The piriformis and external rotators were identified. These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule. The hip was dislocated. A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating. The femoral head was removed. Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum. Baseline leg-length measurements were taken. The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed. Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas. The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit. The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction. Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw. Excellent purchase was obtained. The trial liner was placed. The femur was then flexed and internally rotated. The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion. An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal. Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached. The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version. Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement. Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation. The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination. Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability. The real stem was opened and impacted into position. The real head was impacted atop the stem. If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version. Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component. Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent. Adequate hemostasis was obtained. Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction. The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy. The gluteus maximus was repaired using 0 Ethibond and 0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures. The skin was closed with nylon. Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold pack and Ace wrap. The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right ankle trimalleolar fracture. 2. Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Delayed open reduction internal fixation with plates and screws, 6-hole contoured distal fibular plate and screws reducing posterolateral malleolar fragment, as well as medial malleolar fragment. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right ankle trimalleolar fracture. 2. Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment. TOURNIQUET TIME: 80 minutes. HISTORY: This 50-year-old gentleman was from the area and riding his motorcycle in Kentucky. The patient lost control of his motorcycle when he was traveling approximately 40 mile per hour. He was on a curve and lost control. He is unsure what exactly happened, but he thinks his right ankle was pinned underneath the motorcycle while he was sliding. There were no other injuries. He was treated in Kentucky. A close reduction was performed and splint applied. Orthopedic surgeon called myself with regards to this patient's fracture management and suggested a CT scan. The patient returned to Ohio and his friend drove him all the way from Kentucky to Northwest Ohio overnight. The patient showed up in the emergency department where a CT scan was asked to be performed. This was performed and reviewed. The patient, however, had significant amount of soft tissue swelling and therefore he was asked to follow up in 2 days. At this time, he still had significant swelling, but because of the amount of swelling that he had particularly with the long car ride for many hours with his leg dependent, it was felt to be best to wait. Indeed after 7 days, the patient started to develop fracture blisters on the posterior medial aspect of his ankle with large blisters measuring approximately 2 to 3 inches. The patient was x-rayed in the office. He had lost some of his reduction. Therefore, he was re-reduced at approximately 7 days and then each time the patient had examination of tissues, he was re-reduced just to keep the pressure off the skin. An x-ray showed the distal fibular fracture starting at the mortise region laterally. It appeared as an abduction type injury with minimal rotation. This was comminuted, fragmented, and impacted. The medial malleolus fracture was an avulsion type. The syndesmosis appeared to be intact. This appeared as an AO type B fracture. However, this was not a rotational injury. There is a posterior malleolar fragment attached to the distal fibular fragment, which appeared to be avulsed as well, but comminuted. CT scan revealed a more serious fracture with an anterior as well as posterior plafond fracture of an anterior fragment, which was undisplaced in the posterior medial corner. A posterior Tillaux fragment appeared to be separate. However, in this area, there was significant comminution in the mid portion of the ankle joint. There were many fragments and defects in this region. The medial mortise however appeared to be intact with regards to the tibial plafond even though there was an anterior undisplaced fragment. We discussed delayed open reduction internal fixation with the patient. He understood the risk of surgery including infection, decreased range of motion, stiffness, neurovascular injury, weakness, and numbness. We discussed seriously the risk of osteoarthritis because of the comminution in the intraarticular surface shown on the CT scan. We discussed deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, skin slough, skin necrosis, infection, and need for second surgery. We discussed shortening, decreased strength, limited use, disability of operative extremity, malunion, nonunion, compartment syndrome, stiffness of the operative extremity, numbness, and weakness. Examination of the patient revealed that he had slightly decreased sensation on the dorsum of his foot. The patient was able to flex and extend his toes, had good capillary refill, good dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulse. The patient's tissues were edematous and we has waited approximately 10 days before performing the surgery when the skin could be wrinkled anteriorly. We discussed his incision, the medial incision as well as lateral incision and the lateral incision would be more posterolateral to maintain a bridge of at least 6 to 8 cm between the 2 incisions. We did discuss the skin slough as well as skin necrosis, particularly medially where the most skin pressure was because of displacement laterally. He understood the posterolateral comminution of the tibial plafond, which would be reduced by aligning up the cortex posteriorly. We discussed the posterolateral approach with reduction of the fibula. We discussed that likely the distal fibula would not be removed completely to assess the articular surface as this would likely comminute the fibula, even more fragmentation would occur, and would not be able to obtain an anatomic reduction. He understood this distal fibular fracture was comminuted and there were missing fragments of bone because they were impacted into intramedullary cancellous space. With this, the patient understood that the hardware may necessitate removal as well in the future. We discussed hardware irritation. We also discussed risk of osteoarthritis, which was nearly 100% particularly because of comminution of this area posteriorly. With these risks discussed and listed on the consent, the patient wanted the procedure. OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was brought to operating theater and given successful general anesthetic. His right leg was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Before prep and drape was performed, a close reduction was tried to be obtained to see whether there was any obstruction to reduction. It was felt that at one point the posterior tibialis tendon may be intraarticular. The reduction appeared to line up. However, there was significant gap of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm between the avulsed medial malleolus fragment and distal tibia. A lateral incision was made over the fracture site approximately 8 cm long and was taken to subcutaneous tissue. The superficial peroneal nerve was seen and this was avoided. The incision was placed posterolateral to fibula. This was to ensure good flap of tissue between the 2 incisions medial and laterally. The fracture was seen. The fracture was elevated and medialized and de-rotated. The anterior portion of the distal fibula was significantly comminuted with defect. The posterior aspect was still intact. However, there were multiple fracture lines demonstrating a crush-type injury. This was reduced manually. At this point, dissection was performed bluntly behind the peroneal tendons in between this and flexor hallucis longus tendon. No sharp dissection was performed. The posterior malleolar fragment was palpated with the distal fibula reduced. The posterior malleolar fragment appeared to be reduced as well. X-ray views confirmed this. An incision was made, standard incision, curvilinear, medially distal to the medial corner of the mortise and curving anterior and posteriorly around the tip of the medial malleolus. This was taken only through subcutaneous tissue. The saphenous vein was found, dissected out. Its branches were cauterized. Penrose drain was placed around this. Dissection was undertaken. The periosteal tissue was seen and was invaginated into the joint. This was recovered and flipped back on both sides. Next, the towel clip was used. Ends were freshened up using irrigation. The joint surface appeared to be congruent anteriorly and posteriorly medially. Anatomic reduction was performed in the medial malleolus using 2 mm K-wires and exchanging these for a 35 mm and a 40 mm, anterior and posterior respectively, partially threaded cancellous screws. Anatomic reduction was gained. X-rays were taken showing excellent anatomic reduction. Next, attention was drawn towards the fibula. Standard 6-hole one-third tubular plate was applied to this. Again, this was more of a transverse impacted fracture. Therefore, interfragmentary screw on an angle could not be used. The posterior cortex was used to assess anatomic reduction. Screws were placed. It was used as a spring plate pushing the distal fibular fragment medially. Screw holes were filled. They were double-checked. Screws had excellent purchase and were tightened up. At this point, lateral views were taken as well as palpation of posterior lateral fragment was performed in the plafond. This appeared to show anatomic reduction and did not appear to be a step on the articular surface or the posterior cortex of the distal tibia. The screw was then placed from anterior medial to posterior lateral into this comminuted fragment. A 2 mm K-wire was used. Finger was placed on this fragment and the pin was advanced even before the finger. X-ray views could show the posterior cortex and location of the pin. This was then exchanged for a 55 mm partially threaded cancellous screw after tapping was performed. This was double checked to ensure good positioning and this was so. On the lateral view, we could see this was not in the joint. AP views and mortise views showed this was not in the joint. One could palpate this as well. The screw was placed slightly proximal to distal in the anteroposterior plane. At the distal tip of it, it was just in the subchondral bone but not in the joint. There was slight to excellent purchase of this posterior lateral fragment. Wounds were copiously irrigated followed by closing using 2-0 Vicryl in inverted fashion followed by staples to skin. Adaptic, 4 x 4s, abdominal pad was placed on wound, held in place with Kerlix followed by an extensor bandage. Posterior splint was placed on the patient. The patient's leg was placed in neutral position. Significant amount of cast padding were used and large bulky trauma ABD type dressings. The heel was padded and leg was padded with approximately 2 inches of padding. Tourniquet was deflated. The patient had good capillary refill, good pulses, and the patient returned to recovery room in stable condition with no complications. Physician assistant assisted during the case with retracting as well as holding the medial malleolar fragment and fragments in position while placement screws were applied. Positioning of the leg was accomplished by the physician assistant. As well, physician assistant assisted in transport of patient to and from the recovery room, assisted in cautery as well as dissection and retraction of tissue. The patient is expected to do well overall. He does have an area of comminution shown on the CT scan. However, by x-rays, it appears that there is anatomic reduction gained at this posterolateral fragment. Nonetheless, this area was crushed and the patient will have degenerative changes in the future caused by this crushing area.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left patellar chondromalacia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left patellar chondromalacia with tight lateral structures. PROCEDURE: Left knee arthroscopy with lateral capsular release. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. TOURNIQUET TIME: 47 minutes. MEDICATION: The patient received 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic 32 mL. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications. DRAINS AND SPECIMENS: None. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 14-year-old girl who started having left knee pain in the fall of 2007. She was not seen in Orthopedic Clinic until November 2007. The patient had an outside MRI performed that demonstrated left patellar chondromalacia only. The patient was referred to physical therapy for patellar tracking exercises. She was also given a brace. The patient reported increasing pain with physical therapy and mother strongly desired other treatment. It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy. Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered. Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed. Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling. All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans. PROCEDURE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. A medial suprapatellar portal was marked on the skin as well as anteromedial and anterolateral joint line. The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg. Esmarch was then removed. Incisions were then made. Camera was initially inserted into the lateral joint line. Visualization of patellofemoral joint revealed type 2 chondromalacia with slight lateral subluxation. The patient did have congruent articulation about 30 degrees of knee flexion. Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no loose bodies. There was a small plica. Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no significant chondromalacia. Menisci was probed and tested with no signs of tears and instability. ACL was noted to be intact. The intercondylar notch and lateral joint line also revealed no significant chondromalacia or meniscal pathology. Lateral gutter also demonstrated no loose bodies or plica. The camera was then removed and inserted into the anteromedial portal using two 18-gauge needles. The extent of lateral capsular release was marked using a monopolar coblator, lateral capsular release was performed. The patient had significant improvement in anteromedial translation from 25% to 50%. At the end of the case, all instruments were removed. The knee was injected with 32 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with additional epinephrine. Please note, the patient received 30 mL of 1:500,000 dilution epinephrine at the beginning of the case. The portals were then closed using 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was clean and dry, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s. The kneecap was translated medially under pressure and a bias placed. The tourniquet was released at 47 minutes. The patient was then placed in the knee immobilizer. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will weightbear as tolerated in the knee immobilizer. She will start physical therapy within 1 to 2 weeks to work on patella mobilization as well as reconditioning and strengthening. Intraoperative findings were relayed to the mother. All questions were answered.",FALSE

 EXAM:MRI OF THE LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL:Left knee pain. Twisting injury. FINDINGS: The images reveal a sizable joint effusion. The joint effusion appears to be complex with mixed signal intensity material within. The patella is slightly laterally tilted towards the left. The mid portion of the patella cartilage shows some increased signal and focal injury to the patellar cartilage is suspected. Mildly increased bone signal overlying the inferolateral portion of the patella is identified. No significant degenerative changes about the patella can be seen. The quadriceps tendon as well as the infrapatellar ligament both look intact. There is some prepatellar soft tissue edema. The bone signal shows a couple of small areas of cystic change in the proximal aspect of the tibia. NO significant areas of bone edema are appreciated. There is soft tissue edema along the lateral aspect of the knee. There is a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex. The medial collateral ligament complex looks intact. A small amount of edema is identified immediately adjacent to the medial collateral ligament complex. The posterior cruciate ligament looks intact. The anterior cruciate ligament is thickened with significant increased signal. I suspect at least a high grade partial tear. The posterior horn of the medial meniscus shows some myxoid degenerative changes. The posterior horn and anterior horn of the lateral meniscus likewise shows myxoid degenerative type changes. I don�t see a definite tear extending to the articular surface. IMPRESSION: Sizeable joint effusion which is complex and may contain blood products.

" REASON FOR VISIT: New patient visit for right hand pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 28-year-old right-hand dominant gentleman, who punched the wall 3 days prior to presentation. He complained of ulnar-sided right hand pain and was seen in the emergency room. Reportedly, he had some joints in his hand pushed back and placed by somebody in emergency room. Today, he admits that his pain is much better. Currently, since that time he has been in the splint with minimal pain. He has had no numbness, tingling or other concerning symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a nonsmoker and does not use illegal drugs. Occasionally drinks. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 12-point review of systems is negative. MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. FINDINGS: On physical exam, he has swelling and tenderness over the ulnar dorsum of his hand. He has a normal cascade. He has 70 degrees of MCP flexion and full IP flexion and extension. He has 3 to 5 strength in his grip and intrinsics. He has intact sensation to light touch in the radial, ulnar, and median nerve distribution. Two plus radial pulse. X-rays taken from today were reviewed, include three views of the right hand. They show possible small fractures of the base of the fourth and third metacarpals. Joint appears to be located. A 45-degree oblique view was obtained and confirmed adduction of the CMC joints of the fourth and fifth metacarpals. His injury films from 09/15/07 were reviewed and demonstrated what appears to be CMC dislocations of the third and fourth metacarpals. ASSESSMENT: Status post right third and fourth metacarpal carpometacarpal dislocations. PLANS: The patient was placed into a short-arm cast and intrinsic plus. I would like him to wear this for 2 weeks and then follow up with us. At that time, we will transition him to an OT splint and begin range of motion activities of the fingers and wrist. We should see him back in 2 weeks' time at which time he should obtain three views of the right hand and a 45-degree oblique view out of cast.",FALSE
" TITLE OF OPERATION: 1. Austin-Akin bunionectomy with internal screw fixation of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint. 2. Weil osteotomy with internal screw fixation, first right metatarsal. 3. Arthroplasty, second right PIP joint. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Dislocated second right metatarsophalangeal joint. 3. Hammertoe deformity, second right digit. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Dislocated second right metatarsophalangeal joint. 3. Hammertoe deformity, second right digit. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with 20 mL of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain. HEMOSTASIS: 60 minutes, a right ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. PREOPERATIVE INJECTABLES: 1 g Ancef IV 30 minutes preoperatively. MATERIALS USED: 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Prolene, as well as two 16-mm partially treaded cannulated screws of the OsteoMed system, one 18-mm partially treaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system of the 3.0 size. One 10-mm 2.0 partially threaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites. The right ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at 250 mmHg. The right foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique. The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated. Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the right great toe. The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint. All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe. The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely. A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint. Using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and resected with the use of a sagittal saw. The same saw was used to perform the Austin osteotomy on the capital aspect of the first right metatarsal with its apex distal and its base proximal. The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm and noted to accommodate for the future internal fixation. The capital fragment of the first right metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal. Two wires of the OsteoMed system were also used as provisional fixation wires and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws. The wires were inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the osteotomy. The two screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed system were inserted over the wires using AO technique. One screw measured 16 mm, second screw measured 18 mm in length. Both 3.0 screws were then evaluated for the fixation of the osteotomy after the wires were removed. Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent. The dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal shaft was then resected with the sagittal saw. To improve the correction of the hallux abductus angle, an Akin osteotomy was also performed on the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe with its base medially and its apex laterally. Upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the OsteoMed smooth wire, which was also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the OsteoMed 3.0 system. Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was removed. The screw was inserted proximal medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe. Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent. Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be anatomical. Range of motion of that joint was uninhibited. The area was flushed copiously with saline. Then, 3-0 suture material was used to approximate the periosteum and capsular tissues, 4-0 was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues, and Steri-Strips were used to reinforce the incision. Attention was directed over the neck of the second right metatarsal head where a 3-cm linear incision was placed directly over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal. The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized. The incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal. All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal was adequately exposed and then Weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal. The capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted on the shaft of the second right metatarsal. The 2.0 Osteo-Med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw. Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was then removed. Fixation of the osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent. The second right metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint was completely reduced. Range of motion of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent. Then, 3-0 Vicryl suture material was used to approximate the periosteal tissues. Then, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the skin incision. Attention was then directed at the level of the PIP joint of the second right toe where two semi-elliptical incisions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the second right PIP joint. The island of skin between the two semi-elliptical incisions was resected in toto. The dissection was carried down to the level of extensor digitorum longus of the second right toe, which was resected transversely at the level of the PIP joint. A capsulotomy and a medial and lateral collateral ligament release of the PIP joint of the second right toe was also performed and head of the proximal phalanx of the second right digit was adequately exposed. Using the double-action bone cutter, the head of the proximal phalanx of the second right toe was then resected. The area was copiously flushed with saline. The capsular and periosteal tissues were approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and 3-0 Vicryl suture material was also used to approximate the extensor digitorum longus to the second right toe. A 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges of the two semi-elliptical incisions. Correction of the hammertoe deformity and relocation of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint were evaluated with the foot loaded and were found to be excellent and anatomical. At this time, the patient's three incisions were covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage. The patient's right ankle tourniquet was deflated, time was 60 minutes. Immediate hyperemia was noted on the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuffs. The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was transferred to the recovery room under the care of anesthesia team with the vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels. The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery. The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.",TRUE
" REASON FOR EVALUATION: Evaluation for chronic pain program. COMPENSABLE INJURY: Left knee. CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left knee and low back pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. XYZ is an otherwise fairly healthy 44-year-old right-handed aircraft mechanic. On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between. She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area. She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet. She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom. Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding. She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head. She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area. Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality. She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain. She is not working. She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee. Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature. It occasionally awakens her at night. It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated. Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling. VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain. OSWESTRY PAIN INVENTORY: Significant impact on every aspect of her quality of life. The patient is not working and relates no particular functional goals. She does relate that she has put on quite a bit of weight since her injury. Apparently, Dr. ABCD has entertained the possibility of having of revising her tibial tray with a taller one. She has finished physical therapy and continues at home with quadriceps and hamstrings exercises. She has discontinued use of her knee brace. She would like to avoid surgery, if at all possible. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Otherwise, negative. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Otherwise, negative. MEDICATIONS: No medications. ALLERGIES: Phenergan, morphine, Flexeril, Keflex, Bactrim, general anesthetics, Benadryl, and pain meds. FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable for cervical cancer, heart disease, COPD, dementia, diabetes, and CHF. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is not working. Rates her stress level as an 8/10. She is single with no children. Does not smoke, drink, or utilize illicit substances. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A thirteen-point review of systems was surveyed including constitutional, HEENT, cardiac, pulmonary, GI, GU, endocrine, integument, hematological, immunological, neurological, musculoskeletal, psychological and rheumatological. Review of systems is otherwise, negative. See as per HPI. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Weight 255 pounds, temp 97.6, pulse 74, BP 140/94. The patient walks with an antalgic gait to the left. She has pain vocalization with standing, walking, and range of motion of the knee. Head is normocephalic and atraumatic. Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart has regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops are appreciated. The abdomen is obese, though nontender, nondistended without palpable organomegaly or pulsatile masses. The skin is warm and dry to the touch with peripheral pulses equally palpable over the radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial areas. Neurological examination of the upper extremities is grossly intact to sensory and motor testing. Lower extremity neurologic exam reveals positive Tinel's features over the lateral aspect of the left fibular head. There is sensitivity over the distal aspect of her midline scar. No dystrophic features are evident. There is edema over the anterior tibial plateau and tenderness over both the medial, as well as lateral aspects of the tibial plateau. There is no discernible erythema over the knee. No discoloration. No trophic changes. She can extend almost to roughly about 10 and can flex to just at around 90 with pain behaviors. The patient is able to perform a straight leg lift and has otherwise normal engagement of all her distal musculature. Palpation of her axial skeleton reveals no bony step-off, skin tags, clefts or deformities. There is mild lumbar facetal features at the lumbosacral junction with extension and lateral bending. I can detect no clear pelvic asymmetry. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Status post left knee injury with subsequent knee replacement and continued chronic painful left knee, mostly mechanical low back pain without evidence of radicular features. I think she may have a small sensory neuralgia of her left common peroneal nerve and has ongoing pain over her tibial plateau. The patient is not yet a year out from her surgery and understands that it may take several more months for her knee to settle down. There is no MR evidence of marrow edema or ligamentous disruption. She may have patellofemoral and/or tibial plateau related pain as well. She may do extremely well on a chronic pain program and is intolerant to most oral analgesics. She has worked since her date of injury and will need a graduated incremental return to her normal activities of daily living. Therefore, I have referred her for a chronic pain program through the Pain Care Center to be seen in followup upon completion.",FALSE
" PROCEDURE: Trigger thumb release. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A transverse incision was made over the MPJ crease of the thumb. Dissection was carried down to the flexor sheath with care taken to identify and protect the neurovascular bundles. The flexor sheath was opened under direct vision with a scalpel, and then a scissor was used to release the A1 pulley under direct vision on the radial side, from its proximal extent to its distal extent at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the proximal phalanx. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. The flexor pollicis longus tendon was identified and atraumatically pulled to ensure that no triggering remained. The patient then actively moved the thumb and no triggering was noted. After irrigating out the wound with copious amounts of sterile saline, the skin was closed with 5-0 nylon simple interrupted sutures. The wound was dressed and the patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right failed total knee arthroplasty. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right failed total knee arthroplasty. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Revision right total knee arthroplasty. FIRST ANESTHESIA: Spinal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Approximately 75 cc. TOURNIQUET TIME: 123 minutes. Then it was let down for approximately 15 minutes and then reinflated for another 26 minutes for a total of 149 minutes. COMPONENTS: A Zimmer NexGen Legacy knee size D right stemmed femoral component was used. A NexGen femoral component with a distal femoral augmented block, size 5 mm. A NexGen tibial component, size 3 mm was used. A size 14 mm constrained polyethylene surface was used as well. Original patellar component that the patient had was maintained. COMPLICATIONS: None. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of knee pain for 13 years. She had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility. She had continued pain, snapping, malalignment, difficulty with ambulation, and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgery. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table. Department of Anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic. Once adequately anesthetized, the patient was placed in a supine position. Care was ensured and she was adequately secured and well padded in position. Once this was obtained, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Tourniquet was inflated to approximately 325 mmHg on the right thigh. At this point, an incision was made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum. A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then made by using a second knife and this was taken both distally and proximally to allow us to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface. There was noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection, however, intraoperative cultures were taken to asses this as well. At this point, the previous articular surface was then removed using an osteotome until this was left free and then removed. This was done without difficulty. Attention was then directed removing the femoral component. Osteotome was taken around each of the edges until this was gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor was placed around it and this was back flapped until this was easily removed. After this was performed, attention was then directed to the tibial component. An osteotome was again inserted around the surface and this was easily pried loose. There was noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation. This was evaluated. The bone stalk appeared to be adequate, however, there were noted to be some deficits where we need to trim cement, so we elected to proceed with stemmed component. The attention was first directed to the femur and the femoral canal was opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the Zimmer stemmed component. At this point, the distal femoral cut was evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this was noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving us a large deficit of the medial femoral cut. We elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut. We elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12. At this point, the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head was then placed. Care was ensured that this was aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis. Once this was pinned in position, approximately a six degree valgus cut was then made. This allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally. The anterior cut was checked next using the intramedullary guide. The anterior surface cutting block was then placed. This aligned us to anterior cutting block. We ensured again that rotation was aligned with the epicondylar axis. Once this was adequately aligned with this and gave us some external rotation, this was pinned in position and new anterior cut was made. It was noted that minimal bone was taken off the surface, only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface. _______ was then removed and the chamfer cutting guide was then placed on. This allowed us to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cuts of the distal femur. Once this was placed and pinned in position. Care was then again taken to check that this was in proper rotation and then the chamfer cuts were recut. It was noted that the anterior chamfers did not need to be cut, take off no bone. The posterior chamfers did remove some bony aspects. This was also taken off some of the posterior aspects of the condyles and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component. After all these cuts were taken, the guides were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment was then placed. This appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position. It appeared to be satisfactory. At this point, this was removed and attention was then directed to the tibia. The intramedullary canal was again opened up using a proximal drill and this was reamed to the appropriate size until good _______ was obtained. At this point, the intramedullary guide was used to evaluate a tibial cut. This appeared to be adequate, however, we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give us a new fresh bony surface. The cutting guide was placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod, which allowed us to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component. At this point, this was pinned in position and the tibial cut was made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone. This was again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component was then placed as well as the trial augmented stemmed femoral component. This was placed in a proper position. A 10 mm articular surface was placed in the knee and this was taken through range of motion. This was found to have better alignment and satisfactory position. We elected to take an intraoperative x-ray at this point, to evaluate our cut. The intraoperative x-ray demonstrates satisfactory cuts and alignment of the prosthesis. At this point, all trials were removed. The patella was then examined. The rongeur was used to remove the surrounding synovium. The patella was evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt, however, this was very mild and overall had a good position and was well fixed to the bone. It was elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that was previously placed. At this point, the joint again was reevaluated and any bone loose fragments removed. There was noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophytes. These were removed with a rongeur. At this time, while preparing the canals, the tourniquet was deflated due to it being 123 minutes. Approximately 10 minutes did get by, as the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried. The tourniquet was then reinflated. The canals were prepped for cementing. They were suction-dried and cleaned. The tibial component was cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it was adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that was previously tried with the trial. Once this was fixed and secured, all extra cement was removed and attention was directed to the femoral component. The stemmed femoral component was then impacted in position and cemented. Again care was ensured that it was in adequate position and proper rotation. A size 14 mm poly was then inserted in between to provide compression. This was then taken through extension and held until cement cured. This was then removed and the components were evaluated. All excess cement was removed and they were well fixed. Size 14 mm trial Poly was then placed and this was taken through range of motion. This was found to have excellent range of motion and good stability. It was elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm Poly. This gave us extra Poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion. The final articular surface was then placed and tightened into position to allow to _______ secured. The knee was then reduced and the knee was taken through range of motion. The patella was tracking with no-touch technique and adequately positioned. At this point, the tourniquet was deflated for second time and then the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. All bleeding was cauterized using a Bovie cautery. The retinaculum was then repaired using #1 Ethibond in a figure-of-eight fashion. This was reinforced with a running #2-0 Vicryl. The knee was then flexed and noted that the patella was tracking with good alignment. The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. A drain was placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage. At this point, the subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl. Skin was approximated with skin clips. Sterile dressing of Adaptic, 4x4, Webril, and ABDs were then placed. A large Dupre dressing was then placed up the entire lower extremity. The patient was then transferred back to recovery in supine position. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.",FALSE

" PROCEDURES 1. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. 2. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression. 3. Arthroscopic extensive debridement, superior labrum anterior and posterior tear. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic. Once the patient was under general anesthetic, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed. It revealed no patholigamentous laxity. The patient was then carefully positioned into a beach-chair position. We maintained the natural alignment of the head, neck, and thorax at all times. The shoulder and upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Once we fully prepped and draped, we then began the surgery. We injected the glenohumeral joint with sterile saline with a spinal needle. This consisted of 60 cc of fluid. We then made a posterior incision for our portal, 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion. Through this incision, a blunt trocar and cannula were placed in the glenohumeral joint. Through the cannula, a camera was placed; and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline through a preoperative feed. We then carefully examined the glenohumeral joint. We found the articular surface to be in good condition. There was a superior labral tear (SLAP). This was extensively debrided using a shaver through an anterior portal. We also found a full thickness rotator cuff tear. We then drained the glenohumeral joint. We redirected our camera into the subacromial space. An anterolateral portal was made, both superior and inferior. We then proceeded to perform a subacromial decompression using high-speed shaver. The bursa was extensively debrided. We then abraded the bone over the footprint of where the rotator cuff is usually attached. The corkscrew anchors were used to perform a rotator cuff repair. Pictures were taken. Through a separate incision, an indwelling pain catheter was then placed. It was carefully positioned. Pictures were taken. We then drained the joint. All instruments were removed. The patient did receive IV antibiotic preoperatively. All portals were closed using 4-0 nylon sutures. Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and OpSite were applied over the pain pump. ABD, tape, and a sling were also applied. A Cryo/Cuff was also placed over the shoulder. The patient was taken out of the beach-chair position maintaining the neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax. The patient was extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition. I then went out and spoke with the family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care.",FALSE
" DIAGNOSES: 1. Cervical dystonia. 2. Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome. Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side. She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago. She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone. The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is appropriate. She is well dressed and oriented x3. She still smells of some cigarette smoke. Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles. There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved. On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding. This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved. TREATMENT PLAN: After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles. A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated. The procedure is being scheduled. The patient's medications are refilled. She will continue to see Dr. Berry and continue her therapy with Mary Hotchkinson in Victoria.",FALSE
" REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity. The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain. This has subsequently resolved. She started vigorous workouts in November 2005. In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician. By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made. She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits. She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe. Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe. She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm. She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg. Symptoms have been mildly progressive. She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above. She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms. No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below. She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised. At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Ocular migraines. 2. Myomectomy. 3. Infertility. 4. Hyperglycemia. 5. Asthma. 6. Hypercholesterolemia. MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort. ALLERGIES: Penicillin and aspirin. Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet. Of note, she does not drink or smoke. She is married with two adopted children. She is a paralegal specialist. She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds. Pain scale is 0. A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart. Of note, she has a normal general examination. Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk. She has mild postural tremor in both arms. She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities. Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis. She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left. Babinski's are downgoing. PERTINENT DATA: MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed. MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits. MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema. There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space. I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level. She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression. History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy. Results were discussed with the patient and her mother. I am concerned about progressive symptoms. Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis. If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis. I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation. I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem. I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving. The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dural tear, postoperative laminectomy, L4-L5. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Dural tear, postoperative laminectomy, L4-L5. 2. Laterolisthesis, L4-L5. 3. Spinal instability, L4-L5. OPERATIONS PERFORMED 1. Complete laminectomy, L4. 2. Complete laminectomy plus facetectomy, L3-L4 level. 3. A dural repair, right sided, on the lateral sheath, subarticular recess at the L4 pedicle level. 4. Posterior spinal instrumentation, L4 to S1, using Synthes Pangea System. 5. Posterior spinal fusion, L4 to S1. 6. Insertion of morselized autograft, L4 to S1. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 500 mL. COMPLICATIONS: None. DRAINS: Hemovac x1. DISPOSITION: Vital signs stable, taken to the recovery room in a satisfactory condition, extubated. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 48-year-old gentleman who has had a prior decompression several weeks ago. He presented several days later with headaches as well as a draining wound. He was subsequently taken back for a dural repair. For the last 10 to 11 days, he has been okay except for the last two days he has had increasing headaches, has nausea, vomiting, as well as positional migraines. He has fullness in the back of his wound. The patient's risks and benefits have been conferred him due to the fact that he does have persistent spinal leak. The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration of his wound with dural repair with possible stabilization pending what we find intraoperatively. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #7. The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated under general anesthesia without any difficulties. The patient was given intraoperative antibiotics. The patient was rolled onto the OSI table in usual prone position and prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Initially, a midline incision was made from the cephalad to caudad level. Full-thickness skin flaps were developed. It was seen immediately that there was large amount of copious fluid emanating from the wound, clear-like fluid, which was the cerebrospinal fluid. Cultures were taken, aerobic, anaerobic, AFB, fungal. Once this was done, the paraspinal muscles were affected from the posterior elements. It was seen that there were no facet complexes on the right side at L4-L5 and L5-S1. It was seen that the spine was listhesed at L5 and that the dural sac was pinched at the L4-5 level from the listhesis. Once this was done; however, the fluid emanating from the dura could not be seen appropriately. Complete laminectomy at L4 was performed as well extending the L5 laminectomy more to the left. Complete laminectomy at L3 was done. Once this was done within the subarticular recess on the right side at the L4 pedicle level, a rent in the dura was seen. Once this was appropriately cleaned, the dural edges were approximated using a running 6-0 Prolene suture. A Valsalva confirmed no significant lead after the repair was made. There was a significant laterolisthesis at L4-L5 and due to the fact that there were no facet complexes at L5-S1 and L4-L5 on the right side as well as there was a significant concavity on the right L4-L5 disk space which was demonstrated from intraoperative x-rays and compared to preoperative x-rays, it was decided from an instrumentation. The lateral pedicle screws were placed at L4, L5, and S1 using the standard technique of Magerl. After this the standard starting point was made. Trajectory was completed with gearshift and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of the pedicle wall. Once this was done, this was undertapped at 1 mm and resounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall. The screws were subsequently placed. Tricortical purchase was obtained at S1 ________ appropriate size screws. Precontoured titanium rod was then appropriately planned and placed between the screws at L4, L5, and S1. This was done on the right side first. The screw was torqued at S1 appropriately and subsequently at L5. Minimal compression was then placed between L5 and L4 to correct the concavity as well as laterolisthesis and the screw appropriately torqued at L4. Neutral compression distraction was obtained on the left side. Screws were torqued at L4, L5, and S1 appropriately. Good placement was seen both in AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy. Laterolisthesis corrected appropriately at L4 and L5. Posterior spinal fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements at L4-L5 and the sacral ala with a curette. Once good bleeding subchondral bone was appreciated, the morselized bone from the laminectomy was morselized with corticocancellous bone chips together with demineralized bone matrix. This was placed in the posterior lateral gutters. DuraGen was then placed over the dural repair, and after this, fibrin glue was placed appropriately. Deep retractors then removed from the confines of the wound. Fascia was closed using interrupted Prolene running suture #1. Once this was done, suprafascial drain was placed appropriately. Subcutaneous tissues were opposed using a 2-0 Prolene suture. The dermal edges were approximated using staples. Wound was dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4 x 4's, and tape. The drain was connected appropriately. The patient was rolled on stretcher in usual supine position, extubated uneventfully, and taken back to the recovery room in a satisfactory stable condition. No complications arose.",TRUE

Fascial lengthening flap of the 1st dorsal compartment. ANESTHESIA: MAC. COMPLICATIONS: None. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After MAC anesthesia and appropriate antibiotics were administered, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with an Esmarch and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I made a transverse incision just distal to the radial styloid. Dissection was carried down directly to the 1st dorsal compartment with the superficial radial nerve identified and protected. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. I dissected the sheath superficially free of any other structures, specifically the superficial radial nerve. I then incised it under direct vision dorsal to its axis and incised it both proximally and distally. The EPB subsheath was likewise released. I irrigated the wound thoroughly. In order to prevent tendon subluxation, I then back-cut both the dorsal and volar leafs of the sheath so that I could close them in an extended and lengthened position. I did this with 3-0 Vicryl. I then passed an instrument underneath to check and make sure that the sheath was not too tight. I then irrigated it and closed the skin, and then I dressed and splinted the wrist appropriately. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cervical spondylosis at C3-C4 with cervical radiculopathy and spinal cord compression. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cervical spondylosis at C3-C4 with cervical radiculopathy and spinal cord compression. OPERATION PERFORMED 1. Anterior cervical discectomy of C3-C4. 2. Removal of herniated disc and osteophytes. 3. Bilateral C4 nerve root decompression. 4. Harvesting of bone for autologous vertebral bodies for creation of arthrodesis. 5. Grafting of fibular allograft bone for creation of arthrodesis. 6. Creation of arthrodesis via an anterior technique with fibular allograft bone and autologous bone from the vertebral bodies. 7. Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation using the operating microscope and microdissection technique. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This 62-year-old man has progressive and intractable right C4 radiculopathy with neck and shoulder pain. Conservative therapy has failed to improve the problem. Imaging studies showed severe spondylosis of C3-C4 with neuroforaminal narrowing and spinal cord compression. A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the nature of the procedure including all risks and alternatives. He clearly understood it and had no further questions and requested that I proceed. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated using a fiberoptic technique. The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion doses. The neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A transverse incision was made on a skin crease on the left side of the neck. Dissection was carried down through the platysmal musculature and the anterior spine was exposed. The medial borders of the longus colli muscles were dissected free from their attachments to the spine. A needle was placed and it was believed to be at the C3-C4 interspace and an x-ray properly localized this space. Castoff self-retaining pins were placed into the body of the C3 and C4. Self-retaining retractors were placed in the wound keeping the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles. The annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed. Quite a bit of overhanging osteophytes were identified and removed. As I worked back to the posterior lips of the vertebral body, the operating microscope was utilized. There was severe overgrowth of spondylitic spurs. A high-speed diamond bur was used to slowly drill these spurs away. I reached the posterior longitudinal ligament and opened it and exposed the underlying dura. Slowly and carefully I worked out towards the C3-C4 foramen. The dura was extremely thin and I could see through it in several areas. I removed the bony compression in the foramen and identified soft tissue and veins overlying the root. All of these were not stripped away for fear of tearing this very tissue-paper-thin dura. However, radical decompression was achieved removing all the bony compression in the foramen, out to the pedicle, and into the foramen. An 8-mm of the root was exposed although I left the veins over the root intact. The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar procedure was performed. Once the decompression was achieved, a high-speed cortisone bur was used to decorticate the body from the greater posterior shelf to prevent backward graft migration. Bone thus from the drilling was preserved for use for the arthrodesis. Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis. As I had drilled quite a bit into the bodies, I selected a large 12-mm graft and distracted the space maximally. Under distraction the graft was placed and fit well. An x-ray showed good graft placement. Attention was turned to spinal instrumentation. A Synthes Short Stature plate was used with four 3-mm screws. Holes were drilled with all four screws were placed with pretty good purchase. Next, the locking screws were then applied. An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of graft, plate, and screws. The upper screws were near the upper endplate of C3. The C3 vertebral body that remained was narrow after drilling off the spurs. Rather than replace these screws and risk that the next holes would be too near the present holes I decided to leave these screws intact because their position is still satisfactory as they are below the disc endplate. Attention was turned to closure. A Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab wound incision in the skin. The wound was then carefully closed in layers. Sterile dressings were applied along with a rigid Philadelphia collar. The operation was then terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition. The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct and there were no intraoperative complications. Specimens were sent to Pathology consisted of bone and soft tissue as well as C3-C4 disc material.",TRUE
" CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left elbow pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 17-year-old male was fighting with some other kids in Juvenile Hall when he felt some pain in his left elbow, causing sudden pain. He also has pain in his left ankle, but he is able to walk normally. He has had previous pain in his left knee. He denies any passing out, any neck pain at this time even though he did get hit in the head. He has no chest or abdominal pain. Apparently, no knives or guns were involved. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has had toe problems and left knee pain in the past. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No coughing, sputum production, dyspnea or chest pain. No vomiting or abdominal pain. No visual changes. No neurologic deficits other than some numbness in his left hand. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is in Juvenile Hall for about 25 more days. He is a nonsmoker. ALLERGIES: MORPHINE. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Abilify. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Stable. HEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. Conjunctivae anicteric. Skull is normocephalic. He is not complaining of bruising. HEENT: TMs and canals are normal. There is no Battle sign. NECK: Supple. He has good range of motion. Spinal processes are normal to palpation. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: Regular rate. No murmurs or rubs. EXTREMITIES: Left elbow is tender. He does not wish to move it at all. Shoulder and clavicle are within normal limits. Wrist is normal to inspection. He does have some pain to palpation. Hand has good capillary refill. He seems to have decreased sensation in all three dermatomes. He has moderately good abduction of all fingers. He has moderate opponens strength with his thumb. He has very good extension of all of his fingers with good strength. We did an x-ray of his elbow. He has a spiral fracture of the distal one-third of the humerus, about 13 cm in length. The proximal part looks like it is in good position. The distal part has about 6 mm of displacement. There is no significant angulation. The joint itself appears to be intact. The fracture line ends where it appears above the joint. I do not see any extra blood in the joint. I do not see any anterior or posterior Siegert sign. I spoke with Dr. X. He suggests we go ahead and splint him up and he will follow the patient up. At this point, it does not seem like there needs to be any surgical revision. The chance of a compartment syndrome seems very low at this time. Using 4-inch Ortho-Glass and two assistants, we applied a posterior splint to immobilize his fingers, hand, and wrist all the way up to his elbow to well above the elbow. He had much better comfort once this was applied. There was good color to his fingers and again, much better comfort. Once that was on, I took some 5-inch Ortho-Glass and put in extra reinforcement around the elbow so he would not be moving it, straightening it or breaking the fiberglass. We then gave him a sling. We gave him #2 Vicodin p.o. and #4 to go. Gave him a prescription for #15 more and warned him to take it only at nighttime and use Tylenol or Motrin, and ice in the daytime. I gave him the name and telephone number of Dr. X whom they can follow up with. They were warned to come back here if he has increasing neurologic deficits in his hands or any new problems. DIAGNOSES: 1. Fracture of the humerus, spiral. 2. Possible nerve injuries to the radial and median nerve, possibly neurapraxia. 3. Psychiatric disorder, unspecified. DISPOSITION: The patient will follow up as mentioned above. They can return here anytime as needed.",FALSE

ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUID: Per anesthesia. DRAINS: Hemovac times two. COMPLICATIONS: None apparent. SPECIMENS: To microbiology. INDICATIONS: She is a 10-year-old girl who has history of burns and has developed a subperiosteal abscess at her right distal femur. I am bringing her back to the operating room for another exploration of this area and washout. This will be the third procedure for this. At the last time, there was gross purulence that was encountered. Since that time, the patient has defervesced. Her white count is slowly coming down. Her C-reactive protein is slowly coming down. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After informed consent was obtained, operative site marked, and after preoperative antibiotics were given, the patient was brought back to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table, where Anesthesia induced general anesthesia. The patient's right lower extremity was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Surgical timeout occurred verifying the patient's identification, surgical site, surgical procedure, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's previous incision sites had the sutures removed. We bluntly dissected down through to the IT band. These deep stitches were then removed. We exposed the area of the subperiosteal abscess. The tissue looked much better than at the last surgery. We irrigated this area with three liters of saline containing bacitracin. Next, we made our small medial window to assist with washout of the joint itself. We put another three liters of saline containing bacitracin through the knee joint. Lastly, we did another three liters into the area of the distal femur with three liters of plain saline. We then placed two Hemovac drains, one in the metaphysis and one superficially. We closed the deep fascia with #1 PDS. Subcutaneous layers with 2-0 Monocryl and closed the skin with 2-0 nylon. We placed a sterile dressing. We then turned the case over to Dr. Petty for dressing change and skin graft. PLAN: Our plan will be to pull the drains in 48 hours. We will then continue to watch the patient's fever curve and follow her white count to see how she is responding to the operative and medical therapies.",TRUE

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Infected right hip bipolar arthroplasty, status post excision and placement of antibiotic spacer. PROCEDURES: 1. Removal of antibiotic spacer. 2. Revision total hip arthroplasty. IMPLANTS 1. Hold the Zimmer trabecular metal 50 mm acetabular shell with two 6.5 x 30 mm screws. 2. Zimmer femoral component, 13.5 x 220 mm with a size AA femoral body. 3. A 32-mm femoral head with a +0 neck length. ANESTHESIA: Regional. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 500 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. DRAINS: Hemovac times one and incisional VAC times one. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of previous right bipolar hemiarthroplasty for trauma. This subsequently became infected. She has undergone removal of this prosthesis and placement of antibiotic spacer. She currently presents for stage II reconstruction with removal of antibiotic spacer and placement of a revision total hip. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room by anesthesia personnel. She was placed supine on the operating table. A Foley catheter was inserted. A formal time out was obtained in identifying the correct patient, operative site. Preoperative antibiotics were held for intraoperative cultures. The patient was placed into the lateral decubitus position with the right side up. The previous surgical incision was identified. The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in standard fashion. The old surgical incision was reopened along its proximal extent. Immediately encountered was a large amount of fibrous scar tissue. Dissection was carried sharply down through this scar tissue. Soft tissue plains were extremely difficult to visualize due to all the scarring. There was no native tissue to orient oneself with. We carried our dissection down through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer. We incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what was initially felt to be the greater trochanter. Dissection was carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer was exposed. This was used as a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection. The antibiotic spacer was exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur. Dissection was continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum. A cobra retractor was able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure. Once improved visualization was obtained, the antibiotic spacer was removed from the femur. This allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum. The acetabulum was filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue. This was removed with sharp excision with a knife as well as with a rongeur and a Bovie. Once soft tissue was removed, the acetabulum was reamed. Reaming was started with a 46-mm reamer and carried up sequentially to prepare for 50-mm shell. The 50 mm shell was trialed and had good stability and fit. Attention was then turned to continue preparation of the femur. The canal was then debrided with femoral canal curettes. Some fibrous tissue was removed from the canal. The length of the femoral stem was then checked with this canal curette in place. Following x-rays, we prepared to begin reaming the femur. This femur was reamed over a guide rod using flexible reaming rods. The canal was reamed up to 13.5 mm distally in preparation for 14 mm stem. The stem was selected and initially size A body was placed in trial. The body was too tight proximally to fit. The proximal canal was then reamed for a size AA body. A longer stem with an anterior bow was selected and a size AA trial was assembled. This fit nicely in the canal and had good fit and fill. Intraoperative radiographs were obtained to determine component position. Intraoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory length of the component past the distal of fractures in the femur. The remainder of the trial was then assembled and the hip was relocated and trialed. Initially, it was found to be unstable posteriorly. We changed from a 10 degree lip liner to 20 degree lip liner. Again, the hip was trialed and found to be unstable posteriorly. This was due to reversion of the femoral component. As we attempted to seat the prosthesis, the stent continued to attempt to turn in retroversion. The stem was extracted and retrialed. Improved stability was obtained and we decided to proceed with the real components. A 20 degree liner was inserted into the acetabular shell. The real femoral components were assembled and inserted into the femoral canal. Again, the hip was trialed. The components were found to be in relative retroversion. The real components were then backed down and the neck was placed in the more anteversion and reinserted. Again, the stem attempted to follow in the relative retroversion. Along with this time, however, it was improved from previous attempts. The femoral head trial was placed back on the components and the hip relocated. It was taken to a range of motion and found to have improved stability compared to previous trialing. Decision was made to accept the component position. The real femoral head was selected and implanted. The hip was then taken again to a range of motion. It was stable at 90 degrees of flexion with 20 degrees of adduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation. The patient reached full extension and had no instability anteriorly. The wound was then irrigated again with pulsatile lavage. Six liters of pulsatile lavage was used during the procedure. The wound was then closed in a layered fashion. A Hemovac drain was placed deep to the fascial layer. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 PDS, and staples in the skin. An incisional VAC was then placed over the wound as well. Sponge and needle counts were correct at the close of the case. DISPOSITION: The patient will be weightbearing as tolerated with posterior hip precautions.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Internal derangement, left knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Internal derangement, left knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Arthroscopy of the left knee with medial meniscoplasty. ANESTHESIA: LMA. GROSS FINDINGS: Displaced bucket-handle tear of medial meniscus, left knee. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to ABCD General Hospital Operating Room #1 where anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesiology. The patient was then transferred to the operating room table in supine position with Johnson knee holder well-padded. Tourniquet was placed around the left upper thigh. The limb was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Standard anteromedial and anterolateral arthroscopy portals were obtained and a systematic examination of the knee was then performed. Patellofemoral joint showed frequent chondromalacia. Examination of the medial compartment showed a displaced bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus involving the entire posterior, parietal, and portion of his anterior portion of the medial meniscus. The medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were unaffected. Intercondylar notch examination revealed an intact ACL and PCL stable to drawer testing and probing and the lateral compartment showed an intact lateral meniscus. The femoral condyle and tibial plateau were all stable to probing. Attention was then directed back to the medial compartment where the detached portion of the meniscus was excised using arthroscopy scissors. A shaver was then used to smooth all the edges until the margins were stable to probing. The knee was then flushed with normal saline and suctioned dry. 20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the knee and into the arthroscopy portals. A dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were applied followed by a TED hose. The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Comminuted left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with intraarticular extension. PROCEDURE: Open reduction and internal fixation of left tibia. ANESTHESIA: General. The patient received 10 ml of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic. TOURNIQUET TIME: 80 minutes. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. DRAINS: One JP drain was placed. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications or specimens. Hardware consisted of two 4-5 K-wires, One 6.5, 60 mm partially threaded cancellous screw and one 45, 60 mm partially threaded cortical screw and 2 washers. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month. Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee. The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care. Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta. Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone. Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal. Risks of surgery include the risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab. All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient was given Ancef preoperatively. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh. The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch. Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg. Esmarch was then removed. The incision was then made. The patient had significant tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement. We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus. The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires. Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage. There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis. This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer. The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer. The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment. Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible. The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end. The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline. The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s. Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes. JP drain was placed on the medium gutter. The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes. The patient was then placed in a knee mobilizer. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition.

OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: A very active 50-year-old gentleman who had the above problems and workup revealed the above problems. He failed nonoperative management. We discussed the risks, benefits, and possible complications of operative and continued nonoperative management, and he gave his fully informed consent to the following procedure. OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table. After adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. All bony prominences were padded. The right shoulder was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using standard Betadine prep, entered through three standard arthroscopic portals anterolateral and posterior incising the skin with a knife using sharp and blunt trocar. Serial examination of the intraarticular portion of the shoulder showed all the structures to be normal including the biceps tendon ligaments, articular surfaces, and labrum. Subacromial space was entered. Visualization was poor due to the hemorrhagic bursitis, and this was resected back. It was essentially a type-3 acromion, which was converted to a type 1 by aiming the burr anterior from the posterior portal excising the larger anterior spur. Rotator cuff was little bit fray, but otherwise intact. Thus, the deep deltoid bursa and the markedly thickened coracoacromial ligament were removed. The burr was then introduced to the anterior portal and the distal clavicle excision carried out. The width of burr about 6 mm being careful to preserve the ligaments in the capsule, but removing the spurs and the denuded arthritic joint. The patient tolerated the procedure very well. The shoulder was then copiously irrigated, drained free of any residual debris. The wound was closed with 3-0 Prolene. Sterile compressive dressing applied. The patient was then placed on his back in the supine position and the right upper extremity and the left lower extremity were prepped and draped in usual sterile manner using a standard Betadine prep. The attention was first turned to the right hand where it was elevated, exsanguinated using an Esmarch bandage, and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg for about 25 minutes. Volar approach to the carpal ligament was performed incising the skin with a knife and using cautery for hemostasis. Tenotomy and forceps dissection carried out through the superficial palmar fascia, carried down to the volar carpal ligament, which was then transected sharply with a knife and carried proximal and distal under direct vision using the scissors being careful to avoid the neurovascular structures. Cautery was used for hemostasis. The never had an hourglass appearance where it was a kind of constricted as a result of the compression from the ligament, and so a small amount of Celestone was dripped onto the nerve to help quite it down. The patient tolerated this portion of the procedure very well. The hand was then irrigated, closed with Monocryl and Prolene, and sterile compressive dressing was applied and the tourniquet deflated. Attention was then turned to the left knee where it was entered through inferomedial and inferolateral portals incising the skin with a knife and using sharp and blunt trocars. After entering the knee through inferomedial and inferolateral standard arthroscopic portals, examination of the knee showed a displaced bucket-handle tear in the medial meniscus and a radial tear at the lateral meniscus. These were resected back to the stable surface using a basket forceps and full-radius shaver. There was no evidence of any other significant arthritis in the knee. There was a lot of synovitis, and so after the knee was irrigated out and free of any residual debris, the knee was injected with Celestone and Marcaine with epinephrine. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, and the wounds were closed with 3-0 Prolene and sterile compressive dressing was applied, and then the patient was taken to the recovery room, extubated, awake, alert, and in stable condition.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Volar laceration to right ring finger with possible digital nerve injury with possible flexor tendon injury. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Laceration to right ring finger with partial laceration to the ulnar slip of the FDS which is the flexor digitorum superficialis. 2. 25% laceration to the flexor digitorum profundus of the right ring finger and laceration 100% of the ulnar digital nerve to the right ring finger. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Repair of nerve and tendon, right ring finger. 2. Exploration of digital laceration. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 cc. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: 57 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition. BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 13-year-old male who had sustained a laceration from glass and had described numbness and tingling in his right ring finger. GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: After wound exploration, it was found there was a 100% laceration to the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle. The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well. The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position. All bony prominences were adequately padded. Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time. The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The hand was inspected. Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture. The sutures were removed and the wound was explored. It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected. The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact. We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP. We copiously irrigated the wound. Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture. The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact. Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair. Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury. The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve. The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture. The hands were well approximated. The nerve was not under undue tension. The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture. Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed. The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition. Overall prognosis is good.",FALSE

ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 250 cc. INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION: This is the case of a very pleasant 41 year-old Caucasian male well known to me from previous anterior cervical discectomy and posterior decompression. Last surgery consisted of four-level decompression on 08/28/06. The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius. Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis. It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention; however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial. Based on this, I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with no spinal instrumentation. Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery. Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection. Infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection. There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord. This may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma. There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis. This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair. The patient understood the risk of the surgery. I told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress. After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted. Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring. The SSEPs were normal, and the EMGs were silent during the entire case. After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support. Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region. All pressure points were padded. I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision. This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep. After sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10. Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar. Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of C2 was then identified. There was absence of the spinous process of C3, C4, C5, and C6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina. With this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3, C4, C5, and C6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery. There was also a dural tear on the right C3-C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6-0 and later with Tisseel. By careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7. There was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated. At two points, I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam. After repair of the dural tear, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage. Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel. The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia; Vicryl 2-0 inverted interrupted sutures to the dermis and a running nylon 2-0 continuous vertical mattress stitch. The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.",TRUE

PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Bunionectomy with distal first metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, right foot. 2. Akin bunionectomy, right toe with internal wire fixation. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 51-year-old female presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself NPO since mid night for a surgery on her painful bunion through her right foot. The patient has a history of gradual onset of a painful bunion over the past several years. She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes, accommodative padding on an outpatient basis with Dr. X all of which have provided inadequate relief. At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction. The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection. Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed over the Webril. After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% Lidocaine plain was injected into the foot in a standard Mayo block fashion. The foot was elevated off the table. Esmarch bandages were used to exsanguinate the right foot. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected. A sterile Betadine was wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick was used to test anesthesia, which was found to be adequate. Attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion. A #10 blade was used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision. A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer. All superficial subcutaneous vessels were ligated with electrocautery. Next, a linear capsular incision was made down the bone with a #15 blade. The capsule was elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound. A hypertrophic medial eminence was resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head. The medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive changes and eburnation. Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it. A sagittal saw was used to make a long-arm Austin osteotomy in the usual fashion. Standard lateral release was also performed as well as a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex. The capital head was shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head. Nice correction was achieved and excellent bone to bone contact was achieved. The bone stock was slightly decreased, but adequate. Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment. A 2.7 x 18 mm Synthes cortical screw was thrown using standard AO technique. Excellent rigid fixation was achieved. A second 2.0 x 80 mm Synthes fully threaded cortical screw was also thrown using standard AO technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head. Again, an excellent rigid fixation was obtained and the screws were tight. The temporary fixation was removed. A medial overhanging bone was resected with a sagittal saw. The foot was loaded and the hallux was found to have an interphalangeus deformity present. A sagittal saw was used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge. A distal cut parallel with the nail base was performed and a standard proximal Akin osteotomy was done. After the wedge bone was removed, the saw blade was reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy. A #15 drill blade was used to drill two converging holes on the medial aspect of the bone. A #28 gauge monofilament wire was inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone. The monofilament wire was twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole. The foot was loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then improved. Next, reciprocating rasps were used to smooth all bony surfaces. Copious amounts of sterile saline was used to flush the joint. Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer. Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer. #5-0 Vicryl was used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion. Next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was then instilled in the joint. The Steri-Strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. She is to be partial weightbearing with crutches. She is to follow with Dr. X. She was given emergency contact numbers and instructions to call if problems arise.

He complained of pain on the medial aspect of his right knee after an injury at work, which he twisted his right knee. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the operative surgeon, the patient, the Department of Anesthesia and the nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #2, placed on the operating table in supine position. Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The right lower extremity was then properly positioned in a Johnson knee holder. At this time, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 20 cc was administered to the right knee intra-articularly under sterile conditions. The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Next, after all bony soft tissue landmarks were identified, an inferolateral working portal was established by making a 1-cm transverse incision at the level of the joint line lateral to the patellar tendon. The cannula and trocar were then inserted through this, putting the patellofemoral joint. An arthroscopic camera was then inserted and the knee was sequentially examined including the patellofemoral joint, the medial and lateral gutters, medial lateral joints, and the femoral notch. Upon viewing of the patellofemoral joint, there was noted to be grade-II chondromalacia changes of the patella. There were no loose bodies noted in the either gutter. Upon viewing of the medial compartment, there was no chondromalacia or meniscal tear was noted. While in this area, attention was directed to establish the inferomedial instrument portal. This was first done using a spinal needle for localization followed by 1-cm transverse incision at the joint line. A probe was then inserted through this portal and the meniscus was further probed. Again, there was noted to be no meniscal tear. The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no chondromalacia. Upon viewing of the femoral notch, there was noted to be intact ACL with negative drawer sign. PCL was also noted to be intact. Upon viewing of the lateral compartment, there was noted to be a large bucket-handle tear involving the lateral and posterior horns. It was reduced from the place, however, involved the white and red white area was elected to excise the bucket-handle. An arthroscopic scissor was then inserted and the two remaining attachments the posterior and lateral attachments were then clipped and a Schlesinger grasper was then used to remove the resected meniscus. It was noted that the meniscus was followed out to the whole and the entire piece was taken out of the knee. Pictures were taken both pre-meniscal resection and post-meniscal resection. The arthroscopic shaver was then inserted into the medial portal and the remaining meniscus was contoured. The lateral gutter was then examined and was noted to be no loose bodies and ______ was intact. Next, attention was directed to the inner surface of the patella. This was debrided using the 2.5 arthroscopic shaver. It was noted to be quite smooth and postprocedure the patient was taken ________ well. The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry and all instrumentation was removed. 20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then administered to each portal as well as intra-articularly. Sterile dressing was then applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril and a stockinette to the right lower extremity. At this time, Department of Anesthesia reversed the anesthetic. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure and there were no complications.",FALSE

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery. Routine prep and drape was employed. Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure. Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder. A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made. Skin was sharply incised. Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin. Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm. Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve. Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal. Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing. Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free. Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal. Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium. When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures. A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bunion, left foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bunion, left foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Bunionectomy with first metatarsal osteotomy base wedge type with internal screw fixation. 2. Akin osteotomy with internal wire fixation of left foot. HISTORY: This 19-year-old Caucasian female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint. The patient states she has had worsening bunion deformity for as long as she could not remember. She does have a history of Charcot-Marie tooth disease and desires surgical treatment at this time. PROCEDURE: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap. Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in a Mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating field. The stockinette was reflected, the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge. Approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal. The incision was then deepened with #15 blade. All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis. Care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon. The capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone. Capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head. At this time, the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white, shiny, and healthy cartilage. There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence. Attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release. The abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected. The lateral capsulotomy was performed. The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected. Attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw. Intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal. At this time, a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1.5 cm. The capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal. The first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified. A 0.45 K-wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface. This K-wire was used as an access guide for a Juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy. The sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial. The osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges. The cortical hinge was maintained. A 0.27 x 24 mm screw was then inserted in a standard AO fashion. At this time, there was noted to be tight compression of the osteotomy site. A second 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted more distally in the standard AO fashion with compression noted. The ________ angle was noted to be significantly released. Reciprocating rasp was then used to smoothen any remaining sharp edges. The 0.45 k-wire was removed. The foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux. At this time, it was incised to perform an Akin osteotomy. Original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm. The incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx. Again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon. The capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx. An Akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial. After where the bone was resected, it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site. Care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge. At 1.5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire. The #28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight ________ osteotomy site was noted. The remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole. The area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. Capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site. A running #5-0 subcuticular stitch was then performed. Steri-Strips were applied. Total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site. Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. Posterior splint was then placed on the patient in the operating room. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transferred back to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot. The patient was given postoperative instructions to be strictly nonweightbearing on the left foot. The patient was given postop pain prescriptions for Vicodin and instructed to take one q.4-6h. p.r.n. for pain as well as Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. q. b.i.d.

" RICE stands for the most important elements of treatment for many injuries---rest, ice, compression, and elevation. REST: Stop using the injured part as soon as you realize that an injury has taken place. Use crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the foot, ankle, knee, or leg. Use splints for injuries of the hand, wrist, elbow, or arm. Continued exercise or activity could cause further injury, increased pain, or a delay in healing. ICE: Ice helps stop bleeding from injured blood vessels and capillaries. Sudden cold causes the small blood vessels to contract. This contraction decreases the amount of blood that can collect around the wound. The more blood that collects, the longer the healing time. Ice can be safely applied in many ways: * For injuries to small areas, such as a finger, toe, foot, or wrist, immerse the injured area for 15 to 35 minutes in a bucket of ice water. Use ice cubes to keep the water cold, adding more as the ice cubes dissolve. * For injuries to larger areas, use ice packs. Avoid placing the ice directly on the skin. Before applying the ice, place a towel, cloth, or one or two layers of an elasticized compression bandage on the skin to be iced. To make the ice pack, put ice chips or ice cubes in a plastic bag or wrap them in a thin towel. Place the ice pack over the cloth. The pack may sit directly on the injured part, or it may be wrapped in place. * Ice the injured area for about 30 minutes. * Remove the ice to allow the skin to warm for 15 minutes. * Reapply the ice. * Repeat the icing and warming cycles for 3 hours. Follow the instructions below for compression and elevation. If pain and swelling persist after 3 hours call our office. You may need to change the icing schedule after the first 3 hours. Regular ice treatment is often discontinued after 24 to 48 hours. At that point, heat is sometimes more comfortable. COMPRESSION: Compression decreases swelling by slowing bleeding and limiting the accumulation of blood and plasma near the injured site. Without compression, fluid from adjacent normal tissue seeps into the injured area. To apply compression safely to an injury: * Use an elasticized bandage (Ace bandage) for compression, if possible. If you do not have one available, any kind of cloth will suffice for a short time. * Wrap the injured part firmly, wrapping over the ice. Begin wrapping below the injury site and extend above the injury site. * Be careful not to compress the area so tightly that the blood supply is impaired. Signs of deprivation of the blood supply include pain, numbness, cramping, and blue or dusky nails. Remove the compression bandage immediately if any of theses symptoms appears. Leave the bandage off until all signs of impaired circulation disappear. Then rewrap the area--less tightly this time. ELEVATION: Elevating the injured part above the level of the heart is another way to decrease swelling and pain at the injury site. Elevate the iced, compressed area in whatever way is most convenient. Prop an injured leg on a solid object or pillows. Elevate an injured arm by lying down and placing pillows under the arm or on the chest with the arm folded across.",FALSE
" The patient is an 84-year-old retired male who is referred to our office by Dr. O. He comes in today with the chief complaint of low back pain which started about six to eight months ago. He states that he does live here and also travels between here and Iowa and he does have a family in Iowa, which he is very active with his grandchildren doing shopping and plenty of walking. He also recently cut down some trees. He states that he started noticing some pain in his back and his hips and difficulty when beginning ambulation after getting up from a seated position due to the hip pains and the back pains. He states he has not had any treatment for this problem. He just does take Aleve. He states that he began to wear a back brace, which only helps him some. He says his pain is pretty manageable and low when he is not active, but it does increase with more activity that he does. He is very leery about any surgical procedure, even a referral to come see us today for his brother most recently died from complications of back surgery. He states that his back pain is intermittent. On a 1 to 10 pain scale, he rates it a 2. He has tried Aleve, which only helps him some. On the body image drawing, he draws low back pain and bilateral hip pain, no radiating pain down the legs. He describes his pain as 100% in low back and hip. Lying down is the only alleviating factor. Walking, light and heavy exercise exacerbate his pain. FAMILY HISTORY: His parents are deceased.

FINDINGS: The patient brings in lumbar spine MRI for 11/15/2007, which demonstrates degenerative disc disease throughout. At L4-L5 and L5-S1 he has severe disc space narrowing. At L3-L4, he has degenerative changes of the facet with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and annular disc bulge, which caused moderate neuroforaminal narrowing. At L4-L5, degenerative changes within the facets with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy as well causing neuroforaminal narrowing and central stenosis. At L5-S1, there is an annular disc bulge more to the right causing right-sided neuroforaminal stenosis, which is quite severe compared to that on the left. ASSESSMENT: Low back pain, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, diabetes, and history of prostate cancer status post radiation. PLAN: We discussed treatment options with this patient including: 1. Do nothing. 2. Conservative therapies. 3. Surgery. The patient states that his pain is very well tolerated by minimizing his activity and would like to do just pain management with some pain pills only as needed. We went ahead and obtained an EKG in the office today due to the fact that I heard a murmur on exam. I did phone the patient's primary care doctor, Dr. O. Unfortunately Dr. O is out of the country, and I did speak with Dr. K, who is covering for Dr. O. I informed Dr. K that the patient had a new-onset murmur and that I did have some concerns for the patient does not recollect having this diagnosis before, so I obtained an EKG. A copy was provided to the patient and the patient was referred back to his primary care physician for workup. He was also released from our care at this time to a p.r.n. basis, but the patient does not wish to proceed with any neurosurgical intervention nor any conservative measures besides medications, which he will receive from his primary doctor. All questions and concerns were addressed. If he should have any further questions, concerns, or complications, he will contact our office immediately. Otherwise, we will see him p.r.n. Warning signs and symptoms were gone over with him. Case was reviewed and discussed with Dr. L.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left carpal tunnel syndrome (354.0). 2. Left ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (354.2). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left carpal tunnel syndrome (354.0). 2. Left ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (354.2). OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Left carpal tunnel release (64721). 2. Left ulnar nerve anterior submuscular transposition at the elbow (64718). 3. Lengthening of the flexor pronator muscle mass in the proximal forearm to accommodate the submuscular position of the ulnar nerve (25280). ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with intubation. INDICATIONS OF PROCEDURE: This patient is insulin-dependant diabetic. He is also has end-stage renal failure and has chronic hemodialysis. Additionally, the patient has had prior heart transplantation. He has been evaluated for ischemic problems to both lower extremities and also potentially to the left upper extremity. However, it is our contention that this patient's prime problem of the left upper extremity is probably neuropathic ulcers from total lack of sensation along the ulnar border of the left little finger. These started initially as unrecognized paper cuts. Additionally, the patient appears to have a neurogenic pain affecting predominantly the areas innovated by the median nerve, but also to the little finger. Finally, this patient does indeed have occlusive arterial disease to the left upper extremity in that he has a short segment radial artery occlusion and he does appear to have a narrowed segment in the ulnar artery, but the arteriogram shows distal perfusion down the ulnar border of the hand and into the little finger. Thus, we have planned to proceed first with nerve entrapment releases and potentially at the later date do arterial reconstruction if deemed necessary. Thirdly, this patient does have chronic distal ischemic problems with evidence of &quot;ping-pong ball sign&quot; due to fat atrophy at the finger tips and some periodic cracking and ulceration at the tips of the fingers. However, this patient has no clinical sign at all of tissue necrosis at the finger tips at this time. The patient has also previously had an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm, which has been deactivated within the last 3 weeks. Thus, we planned to bring this patient to the operating room for left carpal tunnel release as well as anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve. This patient had electro diagnostic studies performed, which showed severe involvement of both the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the medial nerve at the carpal tunnel. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After general anesthesia being induced and the patient intubated, he is given intravenous Ancef. The entire left upper extremity is prepped with Betadine all the way to the axilla and draped in a sterile fashion. A sterile tourniquet and webril are placed higher on the arm. The arm is then exsanguinated with Ace bandage and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I started first at the carpal tunnel release and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made parallel to the thenar crease and stopping short of the wrist flexion crease. Dissection continued through subcutaneous tissue to the palmer aponeurosis, which is divided longitudinally from distal to proximal. I next encountered the transverse carpal ligament, which in turn is also divided longitudinally from distal to proximal, and the proximal most division of the transverse carpal ligament is done under direct vision into the distal forearm. Having confirmed a complete release of the transverse carpal ligament, I next evaluated the contents of the carpal tunnel. The synovium was somewhat thickened, but not unduly so. There was some erythema along the length of the median nerve, indicating chronic compression. The motor branch of the median nerve was clearly identified. The contents of the carpal canal were retracted in a radial direction and the floor of the canal evaluated and no other extrinsic compressive pathology was identified. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and wound edges were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 nylon sutures. I next turned my attention to the cubital tunnel problem and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made on the medial aspect of the arm extending into the forearm with the incision passing directly between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle. Dissection continues through fascia and then skin clamps are elevated to the level of the fascia on the flexor pronator muscle mass. In the process of elevating this skin flap I elevated and deactivated shunt together with the skin flap. I now gained access to the radial border of the flexor pronator muscle mass, dissected down the radial side, until I identified the median nerve. I turned my attention back to the ulnar nerve and it is located immediately posterior to the medial intramuscular septum in the upper arm, and I dissected it all the way proximally until I encountered the location with ulnar the nerve passed from the anterior to the posterior compartments in the upper portion of the arm. The entire medial intramuscular septum is now excised. The ulnar nerve is mobilized between vessel loops and includes with it is accompanying vascular structures. Larger penetrating vascular tributaries to the muscle ligated between hemoclips. I continued to mobilize the nerve around the medial epicondyle and then took down the aponeurosis between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and continued to dissect the nerve between the FCU muscle fibers. The nerve is now mobilized and I had retained the large muscular branches and dissected them out into the muscle and also proximally using microvascular surgical techniques. In this way, the nerve was able to be mobilized between vessiloops and easily transposed anterior to the flexor pronator muscle mass in tension free manner. I now made an oblique division of the entire flexor pronator muscle mass proximally in the forearm and the ulnar nerve was able to be transposed deep to the muscle in a nonkinking and tension-free manner. Because of the oblique incision into the flexor pronator muscle mass the muscle edges were now able to slide on each other. So that in effect a lengthening is performed. Fascial repair is done with interrupted figure-of-eight 0-Ethibond sutures. I now ranged the arm through the full range of flexion and extension at the elbow and there was no significant kinking on the nerve and there was a tension-free coverage of the muscle without any impingement on the nerve. The entire arm is next wrapped with a Kerlix wrap and I released the tourniquet and after allowing the reactive hyperemia to subside, I then unwrap the arm and check for hemostasis. Wound is copiously irrigated with normal saline and then a 15-French Round Blake drainage placed through a separate stab incision and laid along the length of the wound. A layered wound closure is done with interrupted Vicryl subcutaneously, and a running subcuticular Monocryl to the skin. A 0.25% plain Marcaine then used to infiltrate all the wound edges to help with post operative analgesia and dressings take the form of Adaptic impregnated Bacitracin ointment, followed by a well-fluffed gauze and a Kerlix dressing and confirming Kerlix and webril, and an above elbow sugar-tong splint is applied extending to the support of the wrist. Fingers and femoral were free to move. The splint is well padded with webril and is in turn held in place with Kerlix and Ace bandage. Meanwhile the patient is awakened and extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in good condition. Sponge and needle counts reported as correct at the end of the procedure.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus T8-T9. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus T8-T9. OPERATION PERFORMED: Thoracic right-sided discectomy at T8-T9. BRIEF HISTORY AND INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of right thoracic rib pain related to a herniated nucleus pulposus at T8-T9. She has failed conservative measures and sought operative intervention for relief of her symptoms. For details of workup, please see the dictated operative report. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: Appropriate informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthetic. She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected. Second check was made prior to prepping and draping. Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level. We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars. We dissected down carefully to identify the pars. We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level. We did this under live fluoroscopy. We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well. We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars. The pars was then drilled out. We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord. We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty. Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further. Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well. We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily. We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material. We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root. The Epstein curette removed some more disc material. Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression. We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure. We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure. Hemostasis was meticulous. The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl suture for the fascial layer, 2 Vicryl suture for the skin, and Monocryl and Steri-Strips applied. Dressing was applied. The patient was awoken from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL. COMPLICATIONS: None.

The risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery were discussed. The risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, persistent wound healing problems, and the need for future surgery. He understood all the risks and desired operative treatment. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After appropriate informed consent obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position. General anesthesia induced. Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, cast padding placed on the left proximal thigh and tourniquet was applied. The right leg was redressed. I took the dressing down. There was a small bit of central drainage, but it was healing nicely. Adaptic and new sterile dressings were applied. The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A transverse incision made about the mid shaft of the tibia. A long posterior flap was created. It was taken to the subcutaneous tissues with electrocautery. Please note that tourniquet had been inflated after exsanguination of the limb. Superficial peroneal nerve identified, clamped, and cut. Anterior compartment was divided. The anterior neurovascular bundle identified, clamped, and cut. The plane was taken between the deep and superficial compartments. The superficial compartment was reflected posteriorly. Tibial nerve identified, clamped, and cut. Tibial vessels identified, clamped, and cut. Periosteum of the tibia elevated proximally along with the fibula. The tibia was then cut with Gigli saw. It was beveled anteriorly and smoothed down with a rasp. The fibula was cut about a cm and a half proximal to this using a large bone cutter. The remaining posterior compartment was divided. The peroneal bundle identified, clamped, and cut. The leg was then passed off of the field. Each vascular bundle was then doubly ligated with 0 silk stick tie and 0 silk free tie. The nerves were each pulled at length, injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine, cut, and later retracted proximally. The tourniquet was released. Good bleeding from the tissues and hemostasis obtained with electrocautery. Copious irrigation performed using antibiotic-impregnated solution.

HISTORY: This 47-year-old Caucasian male presents to ABCD General Hospital with a history of tissue mass on his left foot. The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size. The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past. The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap. Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses. The foot was lowered to the operating table. The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux. The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone. The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx. There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx. The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer. Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen. At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx. The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues. Any suspicious tissue was removed. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures. Attention was then directed to the left second toe. There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe. A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass. The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule. This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance. It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon. Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.

Vertebroplasties at T7 and T9 with insertion of prosthetic device. ANESTHESIA: Local with sedation. SPECIMEN: Bone from the T8 vertebra. COMPLICATIONS: None. SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is an 80-year-old female who had previous history of compression fractures. She had recently undergone an additional compression fracture of the T8 vertebrae. She was in extreme pain. This pain interfered with activities of daily living and was unimproved with conservative treatment modalities. She is understanding the risks, benefits, and potential complications as well as all treatment alternatives. The patient provided informed consent. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to OR #2 where she was placed prone on the Jackson spinal table. She was given sedative. The thoracodorsal spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Biplanar image intensification was utilized to localize the T8, T7, and T9 vertebrae. Local anesthetic of 1% Marcaine with epinephrine and lidocaine were 50:50 mixed. Approximately 7 cc was instilled on the left side. This was directly over the posterior aspect of the pedicle on the left. Once this was localized, the right side was localized as well. Stab incisions were then created over the pedicles of T8 bilaterally. Jamshidi needles were then placed percutaneously. Their position was verified in both AP and lateral images. They were advanced slowly under direct image intensification in biplanar fashion. Once these were satisfactorily placed, the inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was inserted into the depths of the T7 vertebrae. The Jamshidi needles were then removed. A biopsy was then harvested with a biopsy trocar placed into the T8 vertebrae. This bone was then removed and sent to the lab. The injection cannulas were then placed over the guidewires and their position was verified in both AP and lateral images. Once this was completed, a second Jamshidi needle was placed at the T7 vertebrae on the left at the entrance of the pedicle. This was advanced under direct image intensification in a biplanar fashion. Once this was deemed satisfactory, it was impacted. The inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was then placed. An injection cannula was then placed over the guidewire into the body of T7. In a similar fashion, T9 was dressed on the left side as well. A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, which was verified in both AP and lateral images. The cement injection cannula was then placed over this entering the T9 vertebrae body. Attention was then turned to the kyphoplasty portion of the procedure at the T8 vertebrae. The balloons were inserted bilaterally. The balloons were then inflated under direct image intensification and pressurized to approximately 200 mmHg. These were allowed to expand and reduce the fracture. Once this was completed, the balloons were deflated and removed. The inner cannulas of all four entrance holes were removed and approximately 1.5 cc of cement was injected in each of the cannulas. This was done directly under image intensification. Once this was completed, additional cement was injected into T9 as there was a larger vertebra. The cement was allowed to cure. The cannula was removed and final radiographs were obtained. The stab incisions were then cleansed with water and antibiotic irrigation. The wounds were then approximated with #4-0 Nylon in interrupted fashion. Compression dressings were applied and fixed with tape. She was aroused and moved to her inpatient bed.

The best results have been either with external fixation or internal fixation, most recently volar plating of a locking variety has been popular, and I felt that this would be appropriate in his case. Risks and benefits otherwise described were bleeding, infection, need to do operative revise or removal of hardware. He is taking a job out of state in the next couple of months. Hence I felt that even with close followup, this is a particularly difficult fracture as far as the morbidity of the injury proceeds. OPERATIVE NOTE: After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, one gram of Ancef was given intravenously. The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in supine position with the left hand in the arm table, magnification was used throughout. The time out procedure was done to the satisfaction of all present that this was indeed the appropriate extremity on the appropriate patient. A small C-arm was brought in to help guide the incision which was a volar curvilinear incision that included as part of this due to the fracture blisters eminent compartment syndrome and numbness in fingers. A carpal tunnel release was done with the transverse carpal ligament being protected with a Freer elevator. The usual amount of dissection of the pronator quadratus was necessary to view the distal radial fragment. The pronator quadratus actually grasped several of the fragments itself which had to be dissected free from them, specifically the distal radial ulnar joint and die-punch fragment. At this point, a locking Synthes distal radius plate from the modular handset was selected that had five articular screws as well as five locking shaft screws. The ulnar styloid was not affixed in any portion of this repair. The plate was viewed under the image intensification device, i.e., x-ray and the screws were placed in this order. The most proximal shaft screw was placed to allow the remainder of the plate to form a buttress to then rearrange the fragments around the locking screws and a locking plate having been selected from the volar approach, a locking 12-mm screw through 16-mm screws were placed in the following order. Most proximal on the radial shaft of the plate, then the radial styloid, i.e., the most distal and lateral screw, the next most proximal shaft screw followed by the distal radial ulnar joint screw. Three screws were locking across the die-punch fragment. The remaining two screws were placed into the radial shaft. All of these were locking screws of 2 mm in diameter and as the construct was created, the relative motion of the intra-articular fragment in dorsal comminution all diminished greatly, although the exposure as well as the amount of reduction force used was substantial. The tourniquet time was 1.5 hours. At this point, the tourniquet was let down. The entire construct was irrigated with copious amounts of bacitracin and normal saline. Closure was affected with 0 Vicryl underneath the skin surface followed by 3-0 Prolene in interrupted sutures in the volar wound. Several image intensification x-rays were taken at the conclusion of the case to check screw length. Screw lengths were changed out during the case as needed based on the x-ray findings. The wound was injected with Marcaine, lidocaine, Depo-Medrol, and Kantrex. A very heavily padded fluffy cotton Jones-type dressing was applied with a volar splint. Estimated blood loss was 10 mL. There were no specimens. Tourniquet time was 1.5 hours.",FALSE

Tailor bunion deformity, right foot. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Tailor bunionectomy, right foot, Weil-type with screw fixation. ANESTHESIA: Local with MAC, local consisting of 20 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain. HEMOSTASIS: Pneumatic ankle tourniquet at 200 mmHg. INJECTABLES: A 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate. MATERIAL: A 2.4 x 14 mm, 2.4 x 16 mm, and 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw. A 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 nylon. COMPLICATIONS: None. SPECIMENS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the usual supine position. At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis. Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site. The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner. An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg. Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made. The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections. All major neurovascular structures were avoided. At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified. This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle. This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed. At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed. Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced. Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision. The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field. A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye. The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position. The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation. At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position. At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation. Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site. Compression was noted to be excellent. All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed. Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field. The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline. At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated. At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon. At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension. Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided. A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal. Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field. Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head. The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position. A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site. This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent. Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field. The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline. The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon. At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site. The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot. The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot. After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A. The patient is to be nonweightbearing to the right foot. The patient was given a prescription for pain medications on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was educated on these. The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well. Dr. A was present throughout the entire case.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Arthroplasty of the right second digit. The patient is a 77-year-old Hispanic male who presents to ABCD Hospital for surgical correction of a painful second digit hammertoe. The patient has failed attempts at conservative treatment and is unable to wear shoes without pain to his second toe. The patient presents n.p.o. since mid night last night and consented to sign in the chart. H&P is complete. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was escorted to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position. Using Webril, the distal leg and ankle was padded and a ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right ankle, but left deflated at this time. Restraining, a lap belt was then placed around the patient's abdomen while laying on the table. After adequate anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a local digital block using 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to provide local anesthesia. The foot was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner. The foot was then elevated and Esmarch bandage was applied, after which time the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was then brought down to the level of the table and stockinet was cut and reflected after the Esmarch bandage was removed. A wet and dry sponge was then used to cleanse the operative site and using a skin skribe a dorsal incisional line was outlined extending from the proximal phalanx over the proximal interphalangeal joint on to the middle phalanx. Then using a fresh #15 blade, a dorsolinear incision was made, partial thickness through the skin after testing anesthesia with one to two pickup. Then using a fresh #15 blade, incision was deepened and using medial to lateral pressure, the incision was opened into the subcutaneous tissue. Care was taken to reflect the subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia to mobilize the skin. This was performed with the combination of blunt and dull dissection. Care was taken to avoid proper digital arteries and neurovascular bundles as were identified. Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint and after identifying the joint line, a transverse linear incision was made over the dorsal surface of the joint. The medial and lateral sides of the joint capsule were then also incised on the superior half in order to provide increased exposure. Following this, the proximal portion of the transected extensor digitorum longus tendon was identified using an Adson-Brown pickup. It was elevated with fresh #15 blade. The tendon and capsule was reflected along with the periosteum from the underlying bone dorsally. Following this, the distal portion of the tendon was identified in a like manner. The tendon and the capsule as well as the periosteal tissue was reflected from the dorsal surface of the bone. The proximal interphalangeal joint was then distracted and using careful technique, #15 blade was used to deepen the incision and while maintaining close proximity to the bone and condyles, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were freed up from the side of the proximal phalanx head. Following this, the head of the proximal phalanx was known to have adequate exposure and was freed from soft tissues. Then using a sagittal saw with a #139 blade, the head of he proximal phalanx was resected. Care was taken to avoid the deep flexor tendon. The head of the proximal phalanx was taken with the Adson-Brown and using a #15 blade, the plantar periosteal tissue was freed up and the head was removed and sent to pathology. The wound was then flushed using a sterile saline with gentamicin and the digit was noted to be in good alignment. The digit was also noted to be in rectus alignment. Proximal portion of the tendon was shortened to allow for removal of the redundant tendon after correction of the deformity. Then using a #3-0 Vicryl suture, three simple interrupted sutures were placed for closure of the tendon and capsular tissue. Then following this, #4-0 nylon was used in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures to close the skin. The toe was noted to be in good alignment and then 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the incision site. Following this, the incision was dressed using a sterile Owen silk soaked in saline and gentamicin. The toe was bandaged using 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban. The tourniquet was deflated and immediate hyperemia was noted to the digits I through V of the right foot. The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where the patient was given postoperative surgical shoe. Total tourniquet time for the case was 30 minutes. While in the recovery, the patient was given postoperative instructions to include, ice and elevation to his right foot. The patient was given pain medications of Tylenol #3, quantity 30 to be taken one to two tablets every six to eight hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain. The patient was also given prescription for cane to aid in ambulation. The patient will followup with Dr. X on Tuesday in his office for postoperative care. The patient was instructed to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact and to not remove them before his initial office visit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and the anesthesia with no complications.",FALSE

Complete tear anterior cruciate ligament, right knee. 2. Complex tear of the posterior horn lateral meniscus. 3. Tear of posterior horn medial meniscus. 4. Patellofemoral instability. 5. Chondromalacia patella. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Diagnostic operative arthroscopy with repair and reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament using autologous hamstring tendon, a 40 mm bioabsorbable femoral pin, and a 9 mm bioabsorbable tibial pin. 2. Repair of lateral meniscus using two fast fixed meniscal repair sutures. 3. Partial medial meniscectomy. 4. Partial chondroplasty of patella. 5. Lateral retinacular release. 6. Open medial plication as well of the right knee. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: 130 minutes at 325 mmHg. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: There was noted to be a grade-II chondromalacia patellofemoral joint. The patella was noted to be situated laterally past the lateral femoral condyle. There was a tear to the posterior horn of the medial meniscus within the white zone. There was a complex tear involving a horizontal cleavage component to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus as well in the entire meniscus. There was a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. The posterior cruciate ligament appeared intact. Preoperatively, she had a positive Lachman with a positive pivot shift test as well as increased patellofemoral instability. HISTORY: This is a 39-year-old female who has sustained a twisting injury to her knee while on trampoline in late August. She was diagnosed per MRI. An MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament tear. She states she has had multiple episodes of instability to the patellofemoral joint throughout the years with multiple dislocations. She elected to proceed with surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament as well as possibly plicate the medial retinaculum to help prevent further dislocations of the patellofemoral joint. All risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with her at length. She was in agreement with the treatment plan. PROCEDURE: On 09/11/03, she was taken to the operating room at ABCD General Hospital. She was placed supine on the operating table. General anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesiology Department. Tourniquet was placed on the proximal thigh and it was then placed in a knee holder. She was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity. Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg. Longitudinal incision was made just medial to the tibial tubercle. The subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery. The tendons of gracilis and semitendinosus were identified and isolated, and then stripped off the musculotendinous junction. They were taken on the back table. The soft tissue debris was removed from the tendons. The ends of the tendons were sewn together using #5 Tycron whip type sutures. The tendons were measured on back table and found to be 8 mm as the most adequate size, they were then placed under tension on the back table. Stab incision was made in the inferolateral parapatellar region, through this camera was placed in the knee. The knee was inflated with saline solution and operative pictures were obtained. The above findings were noted. A second port site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region. Through this, a probe was placed. Tear in the posterior horn medial meniscus was identified. It was resected using a meniscal resector. It was then further contoured using arthroscopic shaver. Attention was then taken to the lateral compartment. A partial meniscectomy was performed using the resector and the shaver. The posterior periphery of the lateral meniscus was also noticed to be unstable. A repair was then performed using two fasting fixed meniscal repair sutures to help anchor the meniscus around the popliteus tendon. There was noted to be excellent fixation. The shaver was then taken into the intrachondral notch. First a partial chondroplasty was performed on the patella to remove the loose articular debris as well as a partial synovectomy to the medial aspect of the patellar femoral joint. Next, the remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament was removed using the arthroscopic shaver and arthroplasty was then performed on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. Next, a tibial guide was placed through the anterior medial portal. A ___ pin was then placed up through the anterior incision entering the tibial eminence just anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament. This tibial tunnel was then drilled using 8 mm cannulated drill. Next, an over-the-top guide was then placed at approximately the 11:30 position. A ____ pin was then placed into the femur and 8 mm drill was then used to drill this femoral tunnel approximately 35 mm. Next the U shape guide was placed through tibial tunnel into the femur. A pin was then placed through the distal femur from lateral to medial, through the U-shaped guide a puller wire was then passed through the distal femur. It was then pulled out through the tibial tunnel using the You-shaped guide. The tendon was then placed around the wire. The wire was pulled back up through the tibial into the femoral tunnel. A 40 mm bioabsorbable pin was then placed through the femoral tunnel securing the hamstring tendons. Attention was then pulled through the tibial tunnel. The knee was cycled approximately 20 times. A 9 mm bioabsorbable screw was then placed through the tibial tunnel fixating the distal aspect of the graft. There was noted definite fixation of the graft. There was no evidence of impingement either in full flexion or full extension. The knee was copiously irrigated and it was then suctioned dry. A longitudinal incision was made just medial to the patellofemoral joint. Soft tissues were carefully dissected and the medial retinaculum was incised along with the incision. Following this, a release of lateral retinaculum was performed using a knife to further release the patellofemoral joint and allow further medial plication. The medial retinaculum was then plicated using #1 Ethibond sutures and then oversewn with #0 Vicryl suture. The subcuticular tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures followed by a #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch. She was placed in a DonJoy knee immobilizer. The tourniquet was deflated. It was noted the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill. She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition. Prognosis for this patient is guarded. She will be full weightbearing on the lower extremity using the knee immobilizer locked in extension. She may remove her dressing two to three days, however, follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for suture removal. She will require one to two more physical therapy to help regain motion and strength to the lower extremity.",FALSE
" CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left hip pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 32-year-old male seen by Dr. ABC several weeks ago for persistent left hip pain. He has a long eight to ten year history of pain into the left hip. He has been worked up by several specialists and evaluated. He was thought initially to have low back pain with radiculopathy. He does have a history of antibiotic steroid use as well as heavy drinking. He reports his symptoms started approximately eight years ago when he was doing some construction at which time he began to have left hip pain. He has had difficulties on and off ever since then. On the last visit, radiographs revealed severe degenerative changes of the left hip joint with apparent AVN of the left femoral head. He was given some pain medication and discussion took place regarding referring him to a specialist for evaluation of possible hip resurfacing versus conventional total hip replacement. He came for a second opinion in the area and we discussed his problems further. He continues to have primarily groin pain, which limits his daily activities. He has used a cane in the past for a short period and he continues to have difficulty with the left hip. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes and high blood pressure. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He had a history of surgery for an undescended testicle. MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Prozac, lisinopril, Norco, and glimepiride. ALLERGIES: No know drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient current smokes. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals significant limited internal rotation of the left hip. He essentially has 0 degrees of internal rotation compared to the contralateral hip, which has approximately 30 degrees. He has significant pain with hip range of motion. There is no significant leg length discrepancy. He has no numbness or tingling distal and 2+ pulses. X-RAYS: Review of films taken previously reveals severe degenerative changes consistent with AVN. ASSESSMENT: Left hip avascular necrosis. PLAN: I had a long discussion with the patient regarding his problem and he voiced understanding. We discussed the possibility of hip arthrodesis versus hip replacement versus hip resurfacing and the high likelihood that any one of these procedures may require further operations throughout his life secondary to his young age and high activity level. We discussed a referral to a hip specialist, who performs resurfacing procedures specifically Dr. XYZ in Houston. Referral will be arranged for him. All questions were answered to his satisfaction. He was also given a prescription of Norco 10/325, #60 and Flexeril until he is able to arrange an appointment with a hip specialist.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bunion left foot. 2. Hammertoe, left second toe. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bunion left foot. 2. Hammertoe, left second toe. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Bunionectomy, SCARF type, with metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, left. 2. Arthroplasty left second toe. HISTORY: This 39-year-old female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint. The patient states that she has had bunion for many months. It has been progressively getting more painful at this time. The patient attempted conservative treatment including wider shoe gear without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment. PROCEDURE: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area. The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap. Copious amount of Webril were placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation was achieved by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo and digital block to the left foot. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating table. The stockinette was reflected. The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. Attention was then directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot. An incision was created over this area approximately 6 cm in length. The incision was deepened with a #15 blade. All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis. The skin and subcutaneous tissue was then dissected from the capsule. Care was taken to preserve the neurovascular bundle. Dorsal linear capsular incision was then created. The capsule was then reflected from the head of the first metatarsal. Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed. A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was performed until the abductor tendons were identified and transected. A lateral capsulotomy was performed. Attention was then directed back to the medial eminence where sagittal saw was used to resect the prominent medial eminence. The incision was then extended proximally with further dissection down to the level of the bone. Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted as access guides for the SCARF osteotomy. A standard SCARF osteotomy was then performed. The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally in order to reduce the first interspace in the metatarsal angle. After adequate reduction of the bunion deformity was noted, the bone was temporarily fixated with a 0.45 K-wire. A 3.0 x 12 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion with compression noted. A second 3.0 x 14 mm screw was also inserted with tight compression noted. The remaining prominent medial eminence medially was then resected with a sagittal saw. Reciprocating rasps were then used to smooth any sharp bony edges. The temporary fixation wires were then removed. The screws were again checked for tightness, which was noted. Attention was directed to the medial capsule where a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed. A straight stat was used to assist in removing a portion of the capsule. The capsule was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl medially. Dorsal capsule was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion. The subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular stitch with #5-0 Vicryl. The skin was then closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress type fashion. Attention was then directed to the left second toe. A dorsal linear incision was then created over the proximal phalangeal joint of the left second toe. The incision was deepened with a #15 blade and the skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the capsule to be aligned laterally. An incision was made on either side of the extensor digitorum longus tendon. A curved mosquito stat was then used to reflex the tendon laterally. The joint was identified and the medial collateral ligamentous attachments were resected off the head of the proximal phalanx. A sagittal saw was then used to resect the head of the proximal head. The bone was then rolled and the lateral collateral attachments were transected and the bone was removed in toto. The extensor digitorum longus tendon was inspected and noted to be intact. Any sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon. Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. Pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and an immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot. The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his clinic as directed.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, severe myelopathy, spinal cord compression especially at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, and progressive quadriparesis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, severe myelopathy, spinal cord compression especially at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, progressive quadriparesis, and very poor bone quality as well as difficulty with hemostasis with the patient having been on aspirin. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE 1. Anterior cervical discectomy, osteophytectomy, foraminotomies, spinal cord decompression at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. 2. Microscope. 3. Fusion with machined allografts at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. 4. Eagle titanium plate from C3 to C6. 5. Jackson-Pratt drain placement. 6. Intraoperative monitoring with EMGs and SSEPs. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 350 cc. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. COMPLICATIONS: None. COUNTS: Correct. SPECIMENS SENT: None. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted through the emergency room for progressive weakness and falling. He was worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. I was consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly. The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. The patient was significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side. I thought that surgery was indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, as well as to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall. Conservative management was not an option. The patient was preoped and consented, and was medically cleared. I discussed the indications, risks, and benefits of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family. The risks of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis as well as plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient. An informed consent was obtained from the patient as such. He was brought into the OR today for the operative procedure. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic. Intubation was done under C-spine precautions. The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron. He was hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baselines and delays. With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area was then prepped and sterilely draped. All the lines had been put in and the arms were padded. Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine. Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 was noted, lesser at C4-C5. Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6. Trimline retractors were put in, and I cut the discs out as well as removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes. With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate as I went. I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plates and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord. Worst findings at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5. Excellent thecal sac decompression was achieved and foraminal decompression was also achieved. With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope was used for this decompressive procedure. The patient was very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing was constant. This was partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which was stopped only 2 days ago, and the option was not available to wait 2 to 3 weeks which would have made this man worse simply over time. I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis. This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case. Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameters under control, bleeding was somewhat slow. I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution. These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position. Excellent graft alignment was achieved. I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6. Fourteen millimeter screws were used; all the screws were tightened and torqued. The patient's bone quality was poor, but the screws did torque appropriately. I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and was really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French was put in with trocar. Decision was made to start the closure. So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staples for the skin. A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing was applied. The patient was extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition. When I saw the patient in the ICU, he was awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side. He had done well from the surgery. Blood loss was 350 cc. All instrument, needle, and sponge counts were correct. No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring. No specimens were sent. The patient's wife was spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative findings and the expected prognosis. The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity. I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on. I do not think there is need for halo rest. We will be obtaining formal C-spine films in the morning. Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Osteomyelitis, left hallux. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Osteomyelitis, left hallux. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Resection of infected bone, left hallux, proximal phalanx, and distal phalanx. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/Local. HISTORY: This 77-year-old male presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping himself NPO since mid night for surgery on his infected left hallux. The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years' duration. He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods. At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction. The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone. He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a &quot;floppy tail&quot; after the surgery and accepts the fact. The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively. The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial. The wound's bases were fibrous. They did not break the bone at this point. They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter. After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection. Due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied. Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected. Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium. Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue. A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered. Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed. Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis. Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery. Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon. The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy. The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade. Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint. Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone. Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx. This bone was removed with a sharp dissection. Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx. This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology. Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx. Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins. The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline. Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin. This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing. The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue. Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology. Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed. Six beads were placed in the wound. Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique. The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits. A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact. He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting. He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice. He is to follow up with Dr. X. He was given emergency contact numbers. He is to continue the Vicodin p.r.n. pain that he was taking previously for his shoulder pain and has enough of the medicine at home. The patient was discharged in stable condition.",FALSE

PROCEDURE: Anterior cervical discectomy with fusion C5-C6. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in supine position. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. An incision was made from midline to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid in the right side. Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply. Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. Carotid sheath was retracted laterally. Longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C5-C6. We confirmed our position by taking intraoperative x-rays. We then used the operating microscope and cleaned out the disk completely. We then sized the interspace and then tapped in a #7 mm cortical cancellous graft. We then used the DePuy Dynamic plate with 14-mm screws. Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for muscle and fascia. The blood loss was less than 10-20 mL. No complication. Needle count, sponge count, and cottonoid count was correct.",FALSE
" HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 26-year-old female, referred to Physical Therapy for low back pain. The patient has a history of traumatic injury to low back. The patient stated initial injury occurred eight years ago, when she fell at a ABC Store. The patient stated she received physical therapy, one to two visits and received modality treatment only, specifically electrical stimulation and heat pack per patient recollection. The patient stated that she has had continuous low-back pain at varying degrees for the past eight years since that fall. The patient gave birth in August 2008 and since the childbirth, has experienced low back pain. The patient also states that she fell four to five days ago, while mopping her floor. The patient stated that she landed on her tailbone and symptoms have increased since that fall. The patient stated that her initial physician examination with Dr. X was on 01/10/09, and has a followup appointment on 02/10/09. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient denies high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, thyroid, kidney, or bladder dysfunctions. The patient stated that she quit smoking prior to her past childbirth and is currently not pregnant. The patient has had a C-section and also an appendectomy. The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident four to five years ago and at that time, the patient did not require any physical therapy nor did she report any complaints of increased back pain following that accident. MEDICATIONS: Patient currently states she is taking: 1. Vicodin 500 mg two times a day. 2. Risperdal. 3. Zoloft. 4. Stool softeners. 5. Prenatal pills. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGERY: The patient states she has not had an MRI performed on her lumbar spine. The patient also states that Dr. X took x-rays two weeks ago, and no fractures were found at that time. Per physician note, dated 12/10/08, Dr. X dictated that the x-ray showed an anterior grade 1 spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1, and requested Physical Therapy to evaluate and treat. SUBJECTIVE: The patient states that pain is constant in nature with a baseline of 6-7/10 with pain increasing to 10/10 during the night or in cold weather. The patient states that pain is dramatically less, when the weather is warmer. The patient also states that pain worsens as the day progresses, in that she also hard time getting out of bed in the morning. The patient states that she does not sleep at night well and sleeps less than one hour at a time. Aggravating factors include, sitting for periods greater than 20 minutes or lying supine on her back. Easing factors include side lying position in she attempts to sleep. OBJECTIVE: AGE: 26 years old. HEIGHT: 5 feet 2 inches. WEIGHT: The patient is an obese 26-year-old female. ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION: Lumbar spine, flexion, lateral flexion and rotation all within functional limits without complaints of pain or soreness while performing them during evaluation. PALPATION: The patient complained of bilateral SI joint point tenderness. The patient also complained of left greater trochanter hip point tenderness. The patient also complained of bilateral paraspinal tenderness on cervical spine to lumbar spine. STRENGTH: RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: Knee extension 5/5, hip flexion 5/5, knee flexion 4/5, internal and external hip rotation was 4/5. With manual muscle testing of knee flexion, hip, internal and external rotation, the patient reports an increase in right SI joint pain to 8/10. LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: Hip flexion 5/5, knee extension 5/5, knee flexion 4/5, hip internal and external rotation 4/5, with slight increase in pain level with manual muscle testing and resistance. It must be noted that PT did not apply as much resistance during manual muscle testing, secondary to the 8/10 pain elicited during the right lower extremity. NEUROLOGICAL: The patient subjectively complains of numbness with tingling in her bilateral extremities when she sits longer than 25 minutes. However, they subside when she stands. The patient did complain of this numbness and tingling during the evaluation and the patient was seated for a period of 20 minutes. Upon standing, the patient stated that the numbness and tingling subsides almost immediately. The patient stated that Dr. X told her that he believes that during her past childbirth when the epidural was being administered that there was a possibility that a sensory nerve may have been also affected during the epidural less causing the numbness and tingling in her bilateral lower extremities. The patient does not demonstrate any sensation deficits with gentle pressure to the lumbar spine and during manual muscle testing. GAIT: The patient ambulated out of the examination room, while carrying her baby in a car seat. ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 26-year-old overweight female, referred to Physical Therapy for low back pain. The patient presents with lower extremity weakness, which may be contributing to her lumbosacral pain, in that she has poor lumbar stabilization with dynamic ADLs, transfers, and gait activity when fatigued. At this time, the patient may benefit from skilled physical therapy to address her decreased strength and core stability in order to improve her ADL, transfer, and mobility skills. PROGNOSIS: The patient's prognosis for physical therapy is good for dictated goals. SHORT-TERM GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED IN TWO WEEKS: 1. The patient will be able to sit for greater than 25 minutes without complaints of paraesthesia or pain in her bilateral lower extremities or bilateral SI joints. 2. The patient will increase bilateral hip internal and external rotation to 4/5 with SI joint pain less than or equal to 5/10. 3. The patient will report 25% improvement in her functional and ADL activities. 4. Pain will be less than 4/10 while performing __________ while at PT session. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN ONE MONTH: 1. The patient will be independent with home exercise program. 2. Bilateral hamstring, bilateral hip internal and external rotation strength to be 4+/5 with SI joint pain less than or equal to 2/10, while performing manual muscle test. 3. The patient will report 60% improvement or greater in functional transfers in general ADL activity. 4. The patient will be able to sit greater than or equal to 45 minutes without complaint of lumbosacral pain. 5. The patient will be able to sleep greater than 2 hours without pain. TREATMENT PLAN: 1. Therapeutic exercises to increase lower extremity strength and assist with lumbar sacral stability. 2. Modalities as indicated for pain and inflammation relief. Modalities to include ice, heat, electrical stimulation and ultrasound as appropriate. 3. Instruction of home exercise program/patient education. FREQUENCY AND DURATION: The patient is to be seen by Physical Therapy two times a week x4 weeks. I have discussed the findings of the initial evaluation with the patient. The patient is in agreement to the plan of care as outlined above. We will refer the patient back to the physician if the current plan does not seem to decrease the patient's pain level or increase her functional abilities. Thank you for this referral. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to contact our office.",FALSE

Left neck pain with left upper extremity radiculopathy. 2. Left C6-C7 neuroforaminal stenosis secondary to osteophyte. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE 1. Anterior cervical discectomy with decompression C6-C7. 2. Arthrodesis with anterior interbody fusion C6-C7. 3. Spinal instrumentation using Pioneer 20 mm plate and four 12 x 4.0 mm screws. 4. PEEK implant 7 mm. 5. Allograft using Vitoss. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. FINDINGS: Showed osteophyte with a disc complex on the left C6-C7 neural foramen. FLUIDS: 1800 mL of crystalloids. URINE OUTPUT: No Foley catheter. DRAINS: Round French 10 JP drain. SPECIMENS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 250 mL. The need for an assistant is important in this case, since her absence would mean prolonged operative time and may increase operative morbidity and mortality. CONDITION: Extubated with stable vital signs. INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION: This is the case of a very pleasant 46-year-old Caucasian female with subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured left posteroinferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, which was clipped. The patient last underwent a right frontal ventricular peritoneal shunt on 10/12/07. This resulted in relief of left chest pain, but the patient continued to complaint of persistent pain to the left shoulder and left elbow. She was seen in clinic on 12/11/07 during which time MRI of the left shoulder showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear. She did have a previous MRI of the cervical spine that did show an osteophyte on the left C6-C7 level. Based on this, negative MRI of the shoulder, the patient was recommended to have anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C6-C7 level. Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with her. Risks include, but not exclusive of bleeding and infection, bleeding could be soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway and may result in return to the operating room emergently for evacuation of said hematoma. There is also the possibility of bleeding into the epidural space, which can compress the spinal cord and result in weakness and numbness of all four extremities as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function. Should this occur, the patient understands that she needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma. There is also the risk of infection, which can be superficial and can be managed with p.o. antibiotics. However, the patient may develop deeper-seated infection, which may require return to the operating room. Should the infection be in the area of the spinal instrumentation, this will cause a dilemma since there might be a need to remove the spinal instrumentation and/or allograft. There is also the possibility of potential injury to the esophageus, the trachea, and the carotid artery. There is also the risks of stroke on the right cerebral circulation should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled from the right carotid. There is also the possibility hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and hardware failure. She understood all of these risks and agreed to have the procedure performed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress. After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted. Monitoring leads were placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics and this revealed normal findings, which remained normal during the entire case. The EMGs were silent and there was no evidence of any stimulation. After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension. The head was supported on a foam doughnut. The right cervical area was then exposed by turning the head about 45 to 60 degrees to the left side. A linear incision was made about two to three fingerbreadths from the suprasternal notch along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to a distance of about 3 cm. The area was then prepped with DuraPrep. After sterile drapes were laid out, the incision was made using a scalpel blade #10. Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to carry the dissection down to the platysma in the similar fashion as the skin incision. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified as well as the sternohyoid/omohyoid muscles. Dissection was then carried lateral and superior to the omohyoid muscle and lateral to the esophagus and the trachea, and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath. The prevertebral fascia was identified and cut sharply. A localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 interspace. Proceeded to the strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C6 and C7. Self-retaining retractor was then laid out. The annulus was then cut in a quadrangular fashion and piecemeal removal of the dura was done using a straight pituitary rongeurs, 3 and 5 mm burr. The interior endplate of C6 and superior endplate of C7 was likewise was drilled down together with posteroinferior edge of C6 and the posterior superior edge of C7. There was note of a new osteophyte on the left C6-C7 foramen. This was carefully drilled down. After decompression and removal of pressure, there was noted to be release of the epidural space with no significant venous bleeders. They were controlled with slight bipolar coagulation, temporary tamponade with Gelfoam. After this was completed, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage. A 7-mm implant was then tapped into placed after its interior was packed with Vitoss. The plate was then applied and secured in place with four 12 x 4.7 mm screws. Irrigation of the area was done. A round French 10 JP drain was laid out over the graft and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly. The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures as well as Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis. The wound was reinforced with Dermabond. The catheter was anchored to the skin with nylon 3-0 stitch and dressing was applied only at the exit site. C-collar was placed and the patient was transferred to Recovery after extubation.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Comminuted fracture, dislocation left proximal humerus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Comminuted fracture, dislocation left proximal humerus. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Hemiarthroplasty of left shoulder utilizing a global advantage system with an #8 mm cemented humeral stem and 48 x 21 mm modular head replacement. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #2, administered general anesthetic. He was positioned in the modified beach chair position on the operative table utilizing the shoulder apparatus. The left shoulder and upper extremities were then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A longitudinal incision was made extending from a point just lateral to the coracoid down towards deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. This incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues were split utilizing the coag cautery. Hemostasis was achieved with the cautery. The deltoid fascia were identified, skin flaps were then created. The deltopectoral interval was identified and the deltoid split just lateral to the cephalic vein. The deltoid was then retracted. There was marked hematoma and swelling within the subdeltoid bursa. This area was removed with rongeurs. The biceps tendon was identified which was the landmark for the rotator interval. Mayo scissors was utilized to split the remaining portion of the rotator interval. The greater tuberosity portion with the rotator cuff was identified. Excess bone was removed from the greater tuberosity side to allow for closure later. The lesser tuberosity portion with the subscapularis was still attached to the humeral head, therefore, osteotome was utilized to separate the lesser tuberosity from the humeral head fragment. Excess bone was removed from the lesser tuberosity as well. Both of these were tagged with Ethibond sutures for later. The humeral head was delivered out of the wound. It was localized to the area of the anteroinferior glenoid region. The glenoid was then inspected, and noted to be intact. The fracture was at the level of the surgical neck on the proximal humerus. The canal was repaired with the broaches. An #8 stem was chosen as it was going to be cemented into place. The trial stem was impacted into position and the shaft of the bone marked with the cautery to the appropriate retroversion. Trial reduction was performed. The 48 x 21 mm head was the most appropriate size, matching the patient's as well as the soft tissue tension on the shoulder. At this point, the wound was copiously irrigated with gentamycin solution. The canal was copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry. Methyl methacrylate cement was mixed. The cement gun was filled and the canal was filled with the cement. The #8 stem was then impacted into place and held in the position in the appropriate retroversion until the cement had cured. Excess cement was removed by sharp dissection. Prior to cementation of the stem, a hole was drilled in the shaft of proximal humerus and #2 fiber wires were placed through this hole for closure later. Once the cement was cured, the modular head was impacted on to the Morse taper. It was stable and the shoulder was reduced. The lesser tuberosity was then reapproximated back to the original site utilizing the #2 fiber wire suture that was placed in the humeral shaft as well as the holes in the humeral implant. The greater tuberosity portion with rotator cuff was also attached to the implant as well as the shaft of the humerus utilizing #2 fiber wires as well. The rotator interval was closed with #2 fiber wire in an interrupted fashion. The biceps tendon was ________ within this closure. The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamycin solution, suctioned dry. The deltoid fascia was then approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous layer was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples. Subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine solution. A bulky dressing was applied to the wound followed by application of a large arm sling. Circulatory status was intact in the extremity at the completion of the case.

OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the hospital after a fall, presenting with neck and arm pain as well as weakness. His MRI confirmed significant neurologic compression in the cervical spine, combined with a clinical exam consistent with radiculopathy, myelopathy, and weakness. We discussed the diagnosis and the treatment options. Due to the severity of his neurologic symptoms as well as the amount of neurologic compression seen radiographically, I recommended that he proceed with surgical intervention as opposed to standard nonsurgical treatment such as physical therapy, medications, and steroid injections. I explained the surgery itself which will be to remove pressure from the spinal cord via anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4 and C4-C5. We reviewed the surgery itself as well as risks including infection and blood vessels or nerves, leakage of spinal fluid, weakness or paralysis, failure of the pain to improve, possible worsening of the pain, failure of the neurologic symptoms to improve, possible worsening of the neurologic symptoms, and possible need for further surgery including re-revision and/or removal. Furthermore I explained that the fusion may not become solid or that the hardware could break. We discussed various techniques available for obtaining fusion and I recommended allograft and plate fixation. I explained the rationale for this as well as the options of using his own bone. Furthermore, I explained that removing motion at the fusion sites will transfer stress to other disc levels possibly accelerating there degeneration and causing additional symptoms and/or necessitating additional surgery in the future. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: After obtaining the appropriate signed and informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general endotracheal anesthesia without complications. He was then positioned supine on the operating table, and all bony prominences were padded. Pulse oximetry was maintained on both feet throughout the case. The arms were carefully padded and tucked at his sides. A roll was placed between the shoulder blades. The areas of the both ears were sterilely prepped and cranial tongs were applied in routine fashion. Ten pounds of traction was applied. A needle was taped to the anterior neck and an x-ray was done to determine the appropriate level for the skin incision. The entire neck was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A transverse skin incision was made and carried down to the platysma muscle. This was then split in line with its fibers. Blunt dissection was carried down medial to the carotid sheath and lateral to the trachea and esophagus until the anterior cervical spine was visualized. A needle was placed into a disc and an x-ray was done to determine its location. The longus colli muscles were then elevated bilaterally with the electrocautery unit. Self-retaining retractors were placed deep to the longus colli muscle in an effort to avoid injury to the sympathetic chains. Radical anterior discectomies were performed at C3-C4 and C4-C5. This included complete removal of the anterior annulus, nucleus, and posterior annulus. The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed as were the posterior osteophytes. Foraminotomies were then accomplished bilaterally. Once all of this was accomplished, the blunt-tip probe was used to check for any residual compression. The central canal was wide open at each level as were the foramen. A high-speed bur was used to remove the cartilaginous endplates above and below each interspace. Bleeding cancellous bone was exposed. The disc spaces were measured and appropriate size allografts were placed sterilely onto the field. After further shaping of the grafts with the high-speed bur, they were carefully impacted in to position. There was good juxtaposition against the bleeding decorticated surfaces and good distraction of each interspace. All weight was then removed from the crania tongs. The appropriate size anterior cervical locking plate was chosen and bent into gentle lordosis. Two screws were then placed into each of the vertebral bodies at C3, C4, and C5. There was excellent purchase. A final x-ray was done confirming good position of the hardware and grafts. The locking screws were then applied, also with excellent purchase. Following a final copious irrigation, there was good hemostasis and no dural leaks. The carotid pulse was strong. A drain was placed deep to the level of the platysma muscle and left at the level of the hardware. The wounds were then closed in layers using 4-0 Vicryl suture for the platysma muscle, 4-0 Vicryl suture for the subcutaneous tissue, and 4-0 Vicryl suture in a subcuticular skin closure. Steri-Strips were placed followed by application of a sterile dressing. The drain was hooked to bulb suction. A Philadelphia collar was applied. The cranial tongs were carefully removed. The soft tissue overlying the puncture site was massaged to free it up from the underlying bone. There was good hemostasis. The patient was then carefully returned to the supine position on his hospital bed where he was reversed and extubated and taken to the recovery room having tolerated the procedure well.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Displaced left subtrochanteric femur fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Displaced left subtrochanteric femur fracture. OPERATION: Intramedullary rod in the left hip using the Synthes trochanteric fixation nail measuring 11 x 130 degrees with an 85-mm helical blade. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 50 mL. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: The patient suffered a fall at which time she was taken to the emergency room with pain in the lower extremities. She was diagnosed with displaced left subcapital hip fracture, now was asked to consult. With this diagnosis, she was indicated the above-noted procedure. This procedure as well as alternatives to this procedure was discussed at length with the patient and her son, who has the power of attorney, and they understood them well. Risks and benefits were also discussed. Risks include bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerves, risk of further surgery, chronic pain, restricted range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of malunion, risk of nonunion, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for altered activities and altered gait, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. She understood these well and consented, and the son signed the consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The patient was then placed in fracture boots and manipulated under fluoroscopic control until we could obtain near anatomic alignment. External positions were felt to be present. At this point, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A guidewire was then placed percutaneously into the tip of the greater trochanter and a small incision was made overlying the guidewire. An overlying drill was inserted to the proper depths. A Synthes 11 x 130 degrees trochanteric fixation that was chosen was placed into the intramedullary canal to the proper depth. Proper rotation was obtained and the guide for the helical blade was inserted. A small incision was made for this as well. A guidewire was inserted and felt to be in proper position, in the posterior aspect of the femoral head, lateral, and the center position on AP. This placed the proper depths and lengths better. The outer cortex was enlarged and an 85-mm helical blade was attached to the proper depths and proper fixation was done. Appropriate size screw was then tightened down. At this point, a distal guide was then placed and drilled across both the cortices. Length was better. Appropriate size screw was then inserted. Proper size and fit of the distal screw was also noted. At this point, on fluoroscopic control, it was confirming in AP and lateral direction. We did a near anatomical alignment to the fracture site and all hardware was properly fixed. Proper size and fit was noted. Excellent bony approximation was noted. At this point, both wounds were thoroughly irrigated, hemostasis confirmed, and closure was then begun. The fascial layers were then reapproximated using #1 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight manner, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated with staples. The area was then infiltrated with a mixture of a 0.25% Marcaine with Epinephrine and 1% plain lidocaine. Sterile dressing was then applied. No complication was encountered throughout the procedure.

PROCEDURE: The patient was given intravenous prophylactic antibiotics. She was taken to the operating suite under the auspices of Anesthesiology. She was given a left upper extremity bier block. Her left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the normal fashion with Betadine solution. Afterwards, a transverse incision was made over the extensor retinaculum of the first dorsal extensor compartment. Dissection was carried down through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue. The dorsal radial sensory branches were kept out of harm's way. They were retracted gently to the ulnar side of the wrist. The retinaculum was incised with a #15 scalpel blade in the longitudinal fashion and the retinaculum was released completely both proximally and distally. Both the extensor pollices brevis and abductor pollices longus tendons were identified. There was no pathology noted within the first dorsal extensor compartment. The wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery. The wound was infiltrated with _0.25% Marcaine solution and then closure performed with #6-0 nylon suture utilizing a horizontal mattress stitch. Sterile occlusive dressing was applied along with the thumb spica splint. The tourniquet was released and the patient was transported to the recovery area in stable and satisfactory condition.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hemarthrosis, left knee, status post total knee replacement, rule out infection. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hemarthrosis, left knee, status post total knee replacement, rule out infection. OPERATIONS: 1. Arthrotomy, left total knee. 2. Irrigation and debridement, left knee. 3. Polyethylene exchange, left knee. COMPLICATION: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: 58 minutes. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This patient underwent an uncomplicated left total knee replacement. Postoperatively, unfortunately did not follow up with PT/INR blood test and he was taking Coumadin. His INR was seemed to elevated and developed hemarthrosis. Initially, it did look very benign, although over the last 24 hours it did become irritable and inflamed, and he therefore was indicated with the above-noted procedure. This procedure as well as alternatives was discussed in length with the patient and he understood them well. Risks and benefits were also discussed. Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for total knee revision, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. He understood them well. All questions were answered and he signed consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. The leg was elevated and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg. A longitudinal incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous tissues. This was made through the prior incision site. There were some fatty necrotic tissues through the incision region and all necrotic tissue was debrided sharply on both sides of the incision site. Medial and lateral flaps were then made. The prior suture was identified, the suture removed and then a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then performed. Effusion within the knee was noted. All hematoma was evacuated. I then did flex the knee and removed the polyethylene. Once the polyethylene was removed I did irrigate the knee with total of 9 liters of antibiotic solution. Further debridement was performed of all inflamed tissue and thickened synovial tissue. A 6 x 16-mm Stryker polyethylene was then snapped back in position. The knee has excellent stability in all planes and I did perform a light manipulation to improve the flexion of the knee. Further irrigation was performed on the all soft tissue in the knee with additional 3 liters of normal saline. The knee was placed in a flexed position and the extensor mechanism was reapproximated using #2 Ethibond suture in a figure-of-eight manner. The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated using staples. Prior to closure a Hemovac drain was inserted through a superolateral approach into the knee joint. No complications were encountered throughout the procedure, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",TRUE

Right shoulder rotator cuff tear. 2. Glenohumeral rotator cuff arthroscopy. 3. Degenerative joint disease. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right shoulder hemiarthroplasty. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Approximately 125 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. COMPONENTS: A DePuy 10 mm global shoulder system stem was used cemented and a DePuy 44 x 21 mm articulating head was used. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 82-year-old right-hand dominant female who presents for shoulder pain for many years now and affecting her daily living and function and pain is becoming unbearable failing conservative treatment. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative suite, placed on the operative field. Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic. Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position. Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded. At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel. At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue. Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis. Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized. At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated. There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable. There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted. The articular surface could be visualized. The biceps tendon was intact. There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface. The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well. At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture. It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure. The capsule was also reflected posterior. At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized. It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact. The humeral head was evaluated. There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head. At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head. The arm was adequately positioned. An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut. This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck. This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed. At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized. The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10. Under direct visualization, this was performed easily. At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins. This was then removed. A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured. It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement. At this point, the trial component was removed. Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut. The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization. All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself. This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point. The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced. The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position. The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion. Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular. The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity. This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear. This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire. After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl. Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied. The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition.",FALSE
" This is a middle-aged female with moderate pain, severe swelling and a growth on the arm which is reportedly enlarging with limited range of motion for three months. FINDINGS: There is diffuse subcutis space edema extending along the posteromedial aspect of the elbow adjacent to the medial epicondyle, extending to the olecranon process and along the superficial aspect of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. There is no demonstrated solid, cystic or lipomatous mass lesion. There is enlargement with hyperintense signal of the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel. There is inflammation with mild laxity of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. The combined findings are most consistent with a ulnar nerve neuritis possibly secondary to a subluxing ulnar nerve however the ulnar nerve at this time is within the cubital tunnel. There is no accessory muscle within the cubital tunnel. The common flexor tendon origin is normal. Normal ulnar collateral ligamentous complex. There is mild epimysial sheath edema of the pronator teres muscle consistent with a mild epimysial sheath sprain but no muscular tear. There is minimal intratendinous inflammation of the common extensor tendon origin consistent with a mild tendinitis. There is no demonstrated common extensor tendon tear. Normal radial collateral ligamentous complex. Normal radiocapitellum and ulnotrochlear articulations. Normal triceps and biceps tendon insertions. There is peritendinous inflammation of the brachialis tendon insertion but an intrinsically normal tendon. IMPRESSION: Edema of the subcutis adipose space overlying the posteromedial aspect of the elbow with interstitial inflammation of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. Enlarged edematous ulnar nerve most compatible with ulnar nerve neuritis. The above combined findings suggest a subluxing ulnar nerve. Mild epimysial sheath strain of the pronator teres muscle but no muscular tear. Mild lateral epicondylitis with focal tendinitis of the origin of the common extensor tendon. Peritendinous edema of the brachialis tendon insertion. No solid, cystic or lipomatous mass lesion.",FALSE

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Idiopathic toe walker. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Idiopathic toe walker. PROCEDURE: Bilateral open Achilles lengthening with placement of short leg walking cast. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. A total of 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic was used. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: On the left side was 30 minutes, on the right was 21 minutes. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 10-year-old boy who has been a toe walker since he started ambulating at about a year. The patient had some mild hamstring tightness with his popliteal angle of approximately 20 degrees bilaterally. He does not walk with a crouched gait but does toe walk. Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family. Family however wanted to correct his toe walking. Surgery was then discussed. Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems. All questions were answered and parents agreed to above surgical plan. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. The patient was then subsequently placed prone with all bony prominences padded. Two bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh. Both extremities were then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion. We turned our attention first towards the left side. A planned incision of 1 cm medial to the Achilles tendon was marked on the skin. The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg. Incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous fat down to the tendon sheath. Achilles tendon was identified and Z-lengthening was done with the medial distal half cut. Once Z-lengthening was completed proximally, the length of the Achilles tendon was then checked. This was trimmed to obtain an end-on-end repair with 0 Ethibond suture. This was also oversewn. Wound was then irrigated. Achilles tendon sheath was reapproximated using 2-0 Vicryl as well as the subcutaneous fat. The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. Once the wound was cleaned and dried and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform, the area was injected with 0.5% Marcaine. It was then dressed with 4 x 4 and Webril. Tourniquet was released at 30 minutes. The same procedure was repeated on the right side with tourniquet time of 21 minutes. While the patient was still prone, two short-leg walking casts were then placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently flipped supine on to hospital gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery. He may weightbear as tolerated in his cast, which he will have for about 4 to 6 weeks. He is to follow up in approximately 10 days for recheck as well as prescription for intended AFOs, which he will need up to 6 months. The patient may or may not need physical therapy while his Achilles lengthenings are healing. The patient is not to participate in any PE for at least 6 months. The patient is given Tylenol No. 3 for pain.",FALSE

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Plantar flex third metatarsal, right foot. 2. Talus bunion, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Plantar flex third metatarsal, right foot. 2. Talus bunion, right foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Third metatarsal osteotomy, right foot. 2. Talus bunionectomy, right foot. 3. Application of short-leg cast, right foot. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 31-year-old female presents to ABCD Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery on her painful right third plantar flex metatarsal. In addition, she complains of a painful right talus bunion to the right foot. She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes and serial debridement and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief. At this time she desires to attempt a surgical correction. The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department Of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart. She was placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for retraction. Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied around the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied. Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department Of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine/4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine/1 cc of Kenalog was injected into the right foot in an infiltrative type block. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. Next, the foot was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the dorsal third metatarsal area. There was a plantar hyperkeratotic lesion and a plantar flex palpable third metatarsal head. A previous cicatrix was noted with slight hypertrophic scarring. Using a #10 blade, a lazy S-type incision was created over the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal, approximately 3.5 cm in length. Two semi-elliptical converging incisions were made over the hypertrophic scar and it was removed and passed off as a specimen. Next, the #15 blade was used to deepen the incision down to the subcutaneous tissue. Any small traversing veins were ligated with electrocautery. Next, a combination of blunt and sharp dissection were used to undermine the long extensor tendon, which was tacked down with a moderate amount of fibrosis and fibrotic scar tissue. Next, the extensor tendon was retracted laterally and the deep fascia over the metatarsals was identified. A linear incision down to bone was made with a #15 blade to the capsuloperiosteal tissues. Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated using a sharp dissection with a #15 blade, off of the third metatarsal. McGlamry elevator was carefully inserted around the head of the metatarsal and freed and all the plantar adhesions were freed. A moderate amount of plantar adhesions were encountered. The third toe was plantar flex and the third metatarsal was delivered into the wound. Next, a V-shaped osteotomy with an apex distally was created using a sagittal saw. The metatarsal head was allowed to float. The wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues, which kept the metatarsal head contained. Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted suture technique. Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique. Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal. There was a large palpable hypertrophic prominence, which is the area of maximal pain, which the patient complained of preoperatively. A #10 blade was used to make a 3 cm incision through the skin. Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue. Next, the medial and lateral aspects were undermined. The abductor tendon was identified and retracted. A capsuloperiosteal incision was made with a #15 blade in a linear fashion down to the bone. The capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade. Next, the sagittal saw was used to resect the large hypertrophic dorsal exostosis. A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences. The wound was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline. #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues. #4-0 Vicryl was used to close subcutaneous layer with a simple interrupted suture. Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique. Next, attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal where a bursal sac was felt to be palpated under the plantar flex third metatarsal head. A #15 blade was used to make a small linear incision under the third metatarsal head. The incision was deepened through the dermal layer and curved hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors were used to undermine the skin from the underlying bursa. The wound was flushed and two simple interrupted sutures with #4-0 nylon were applied. Standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits. A sterile stockinet was placed on the toes just below the knee. Copious amounts of Webril were placed on all bony prominences. 3 inch and 4 inch fiberglass cast tape was used to create a below the knee well-padded, well-moulded cast. One was able to insert two fingers to the distal and proximal aspects of the _cast. The capillary refill time to the digits was less than three seconds after cast application. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedures without complications. She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.

" EXAM: Noncontrast CT scan of the lumbar spine REASON FOR EXAM: Left lower extremity muscle spasm. COMPARISONS: None. FINDINGS: Transaxial thin slice CT images of the lumbar spine were obtained with sagittal and coronal reconstructions on emergency basis, as requested. No abnormal paraspinal masses are identified. There are sclerotic changes with anterior effusion of the sacroiliac joints bilaterally. There is marked intervertebral disk space narrowing at the L5-S1 level with intervertebral disk vacuum phenomenon and advanced endplate degenerative changes. Posterior disk osteophyte complex is present, most marked in the left paracentral to lateral region extending into the lateral recess on the left. This most likely will affect the S1 nerve root on the left. There are posterior hypertrophic changes extending into the neural foramina bilaterally inferiorly. There is mild neural foraminal stenosis present. Small amount of extruded disk vacuum phenomenon is present on the left in the region of the exiting nerve root. There is facet sclerosis bilaterally. Mild lateral recess stenosis just on the right, there is prominent anterior spondylosis. At the L4-5 level, mild bilateral facet arthrosis is present. There is broad based posterior annular disk bulging or protrusion, which mildly effaces the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and extends into the inferior aspect of the neural foramina bilaterally. No moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified. At the L3-4 level anterior spondylosis is present. There are endplate degenerative changes with mild posterior annular disk bulging, but no evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At the L2-3 level, there is mild bilateral ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. Mild posterior annular disk bulging is present without evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At the T12-L1 and L1-2 levels, there is no evidence of herniated disk protrusion, central canal, or neural foraminal stenosis. There is arteriosclerotic vascular calcification of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries without evidence of aneurysm or dilatation. No bony destructive changes or acute fractures are identified. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Advanced degenerative disk disease at the L5-S1 level. 2.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. PROCEDURES: 1. Right open carpal tunnel release. 2. Cortisone injection, left carpal tunnel. ANESTHESIA: General LMA. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS: This patient is a 50-year-old male with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, which is measured out as severe. He is scheduled for the above-mentioned procedures. The planned procedures were discussed with the patient including the associated risks. The risks included but are not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve damage, failure to heal, possible need for reoperation, possible recurrence, or any associated risk of the anesthesia. He voiced understanding and agreed to proceed as planned. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was identified in the holding area and correct operative site was identified by the surgeon's mark. Informed consent was obtained. The patient was then brought to the operating room and transferred to the operating table in supine position. Time-out was then performed at which point the surgeon, nursing staff, and anesthesia staff all confirmed the correct identification. After adequate general LMA anesthesia was obtained, a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the patient's right upper arm. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Planned skin incision was marked along the base of the patient's right palm. Right upper extremity was then exsanguinated using Esmarch. The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg. Skin incision was then made and dissection was carried down with scalpel to the level of the palmar fascia which was sharply divided by the skin incision. Bleeding points were identified with electrocautery using bipolar electrocautery. Retractors were then placed to allow visualization of the distal extent of the transverse carpal ligament, and this was then divided longitudinally under direct vision. Baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect distal to this area to confirm the absence of any remaining crossing obstructing fibrous band. Retractors were then replaced proximally to allow visualization of proximal extent of the transverse carpal ligament and the release was continued proximally until complete release was performed. This was confirmed by visually and palpably. Next, baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect anteroposterior adjacent antebrachial fascia, and this was divided longitudinally under direct vision using baby Metzenbaum scissors to a level of approximately 3 cm proximal to the proximal extent of the skin incision. Carpal canal was then inspected. The median nerve was flattened and injected. No other abnormalities were noted. Wounds were then irrigated with normal saline and antibiotic additive. Decadron 4 mg was then placed adjacent to the median nerve. Skin incision was then closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon suture. The wound was then dressed with Adaptic, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban. The tourniquet was then deflated. Attention was then directed to the left side. Using sterile technique, the left carpal canal was injected with a mixture of 40 mg of Depo-Medrol, 1 cc of 1% lidocaine, and 1 cc of 0.25% Marcaine. Band-Aid was then placed over the injection site. The patient was then awakened, extubated, and transferred over to his hospital bed. He was transported to recovery room in stable condition.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acetabular fracture on the left posterior column/transverse posterior wall variety with an accompanying displaced fracture of the intertrochanteric variety to the left hip. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acetabular fracture on the left posterior column/transverse posterior wall variety with an accompanying displaced fracture of the intertrochanteric variety to the left hip. PROCEDURES: 1. Osteosynthesis of acetabular fracture on the left, complex variety. 2. Total hip replacement. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient in the left side up lateral position under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient's left lower extremity and buttock area were prepped with iodine and alcohol in the usual fashion, draped with sterile towels and drapes so as to create a sterile field. Kocher Langenbeck variety incision was utilized and carried down through the fascia lata with the split fibers of the gluteus maximus in line. The femoral insertion of gluteus maximus was tenotomized close to its femoral insertion. The piriformis and obturator internus tendons and adjacent gemelli were tenotomized close to their femoral insertion, tagged, and retractor was placed in the lesser notch as well as a malleable retractor in the greater notch enabling the exposure of the posterior column. The major transverse fracture was freed of infolded soft tissue, clotted blood, and lavaged copiously with sterile saline solution and then reduced anatomically with the aid of bone hook in the notch and provisionally stabilized utilizing a tenaculum clamp and definitively stabilized utilizing a 7-hole 3.5 mm reconstruction plate with the montage including two interfragmentary screws. It should be mentioned that prior to reduction and stabilization of the acetabular fracture its femoral head component was removed from the joint enabling direct visualization of the articular surface. Once a stable fixation of the reduced fracture of the acetabulum was accomplished, it should be mentioned that in the process of doing this, the posterior wall fragment was hinged on its soft tissue attachments and a capsulotomy was made in the capsule in line with the rent at the level of the posterior wall. Once this was accomplished, the procedure was turned over to Dr. X and his team, who proceeded with placement of cup and femoral components as well and cup was preceded by placement of a trabecular metal tray for the cup with screw fixation of same. This will be dictated in separate note. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The sciatic nerve was well protected and directly visualized to the level of the notch.",FALSE

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: History of compartment syndrome, right lower extremity, status post 4 compartments fasciotomy, to do incision for compartment fasciotomy. OPERATIONS: 1. Wound debridement x2, including skin, subcutaneous, and muscle. 2. Insertion of tissue expander to the medial wound. 3. Insertion of tissue expander to the lateral wound. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET: None. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This patient developed a compartment syndrome. She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg. She was doing very well and was obviously improving. The swelling was reduced. A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination. She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure. The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well. Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. She understood them well. All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm. The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width. Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided. The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion. This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides. At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present. Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander. On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately. I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor. I then did place adequate tension on the sutures. Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller. At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound. The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin. The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors. The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied. It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained. Adequate tension was placed in this region. A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied. No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",TRUE
" EXAM:MRI LEFT FOOT CLINICAL: A 49-year-old female with ankle pain times one month, without a specific injury. Patient complains of moderate to severe pain, worse with standing or walking on hard surfaces, with tenderness to palpation at the plantar aspect of the foot and midfoot region and tenderness over the course of the posterior tibialis tendon. FINDINGS: Received for second opinion interpretations is an MRI examination performed on 05/27/2005. There is edema of the subcutis adipose space extending along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle. There is edema of the subcutis adipose space posterior to the Achilles tendon. Findings suggest altered biomechanics with crural fascial strains. There is tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus with mild tendon thickening. There is possible partial surface tearing of the anterior aspect of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus (axial inversion recovery image #16) which is a possible hypertrophic tear less than 50% in cross sectional diameter. The study has been performed with the foot in neutral position. Confirmation of this possible partial tendon tear would require additional imaging with the foot in a plantar flexed position with transaxial images of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus oriented perpendicular to the course of the posterior tibialis tendon. There is minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths consistent with flexor splinting but intrinsically normal tendons. Normal peroneal tendons. There is tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with thickening but no demonstrated tendon tear. Normal extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum tendons. Normal Achilles tendon. There is a low-lying soleus muscle that extends to within 2cm of the teno-osseous insertion of the Achilles tendon. Normal distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex. Normal lateral, subtalar and deltoid ligamentous complexes. There are no erosions of the inferior neck of the talus and there are no secondary findings of a midfoot pronating force. Normal plantar fascia. There is no plantar calcaneal spur. There is venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot extending along the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves which may be acting as intermittent entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves. Normal tibiotalar, subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid articulations. The metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux was partially excluded from the field-of-view of this examination. IMPRESSION: Tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon with tendon thickening and possible surface fraying / tearing of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus, however, confirmation of this finding would require additional imaging.

" DIAGNOSIS: Left knee osteoarthritis. HISTORY: The patient is a 58-year-old female, referred to therapy due to left knee osteoarthritis. The patient states that approximately 2 years ago, she fell to the ground and thereafter had blood clots in the knee area. The patient was transferred from the hospital to a nursing home and lived there for 1 year. Prior to this incident, the patient was ambulating independently with a pickup walker throughout her home. Since that time, the patient has only been performing transverse and has been unable to ambulate. The patient states that her primary concern is her left knee pain and they desire to walk short distances again in her home. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: High blood pressure, obesity, right patellar fracture with pin in 1990, and history of blood clots. MEDICATIONS: Naproxen, Plavix, and stool softener. MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS: The patient states that she had an x-ray of the knee in 2007 and was diagnosed with osteoarthritis. SUBJECTIVE: The patient reports that when seated and at rest, her knee pain is 0/10. The patient states that with active motion of the left knee, the pain in the anterior portion increases to 5/10. PATIENT'S GOAL: To transfer better and walk 5 feet from her bed to the couch. INSPECTION: The right knee has a large 8-inch long and very wide tight scar with adhesions to the underlying connective tissue due to her patellar fracture and surgery following an MVA in 1990, bilateral knees are very large due to obesity. There are no scars, bruising or increased temperature noted in the left knee. RANGE OF MOTION: Active and passive range of motion of the right knee is 0 to 90 degrees and the left knee, 0 to 85 degrees. Pain is elicited during active range of motion of the left knee. PALPATION: Palpation to the left knee elicits pain around the patellar tendon and to each side of this area. FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY: The patient reports that she transfers with standby to contact-guard assist in the home from her bed to her wheelchair and return. The patient is able to stand modified independent from wheelchair level and tolerates at least 15 seconds of standing prior to needing to sit down due to the left knee pain. ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 58-year-old female with left knee osteoarthritis. Examination indicates deficits in pain, muscle endurance, and functional mobility. The patient would benefit from skilled physical therapy to address these impairments. TREATMENT PLAN: The patient will be seen two times per week for an initial 4 weeks with re-assessment at that time for an additional 4 weeks if needed. INTERVENTIONS INCLUDE: 1. Modalities including electrical stimulation, ultrasound, heat, and ice. 2. Therapeutic exercise. 3. Functional mobility training. 4. Gait training. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED IN 4 WEEKS: 1. The patient is to have increased endurance in bilateral lower extremities as demonstrated by being able to perform 20 repetitions of all lower extremity exercises in seated and supine positions with minimum 2-pound weight. 2. The patient is to perform standby assist transfer using a pickup walker. 3.

" HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 44-year-old man who was seen for complaints of low back and right thigh pain. He attributes this to an incident in which he was injured in 1994. I do not have any paperwork authenticating his claim that there is an open claim. Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05. He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10. He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum. He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time. His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994. The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1. There was no neural impingement. He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Focal lower paralumbar pain, affecting both right and left sides, as well as intermittent right leg pain which appears to have improved significantly with the Medrol Dosepak. He denies any recent illness. He has no constitutional complaints such as fevers, chills or sweats. HEENT: The patient denies any cephalgia, ocular, nasopharyngeal symptoms. He has no dysphagia. Cardiovascular: He denies any palpitations, chest pain, syncope or near-syncope. Pulmonary: He denies any dyspnea or respiratory difficulties.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Hallux rigidus, left foot. 2. Elevated first metatarsal, left foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Hallux rigidus, left foot. 2. Elevated first metatarsal, left foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Austin/Youngswick bunionectomy with Biopro implant. 2. Screw fixation, left foot. HISTORY: This 51-year-old male presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint. The patient states that he has had degenerative joint disease in his left first MPJ for many years that has been progressively getting worse and more painful over time. The patient desires surgical treatment. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap. Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 7 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo-type block. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered to the operating table, the stockinet was reflected, and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. Attention was then directed to the left first metatarsophalangeal joint. Approximately a 6 cm dorsomedial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, just medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon. The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade. All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis. The skin and subcutaneous tissue was undermined medially, off of the joint capsule. A dorsal linear capsular incision was then made. Care was taken to identify and preserve the extensor hallucis longus tendon. The capsule and periosteum were then reflected off of the head of the first metatarsal as well as the base of the proximal phalanx. There was noted to be a significant degenerative joint disease. There was little to no remaining healthy articular cartilage left on the head of the first metatarsal. There was significant osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally in the first metatarsal head as well as at the base of the proximal phalanx. A sagittal saw was then used to resect the base of the proximal phalanx. Care was taken to ensure that the resection was parallel to the nail. After the bone was removed in toto, the area was inspected and the flexor tendon was noted to be intact. The sagittal saw was then used to resect the osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally on the first metatarsal. The first metatarsal was then re-modelled and smoothed in a more rounded position with a reciprocating rasp. The sizers were then inserted for the Biopro implant. A large was noted to be of the best size. There was noted to be some hypertrophic bone laterally in the base of the proximal phalanx. Following inspection, the sagittal saw was used to clean both the medial and lateral sides of the base. A small bar drill was then used to pre-drill for the Biopro sizer. The bone was noted to be significantly hardened. The sizer was placed and a large Biopro was deemed to be the correct size implant. The sizer was removed and bar drill was then again used to ream the medullary canal. The hand reamer with a Biopro set was then used to complete the process. The Biopro implant was then inserted and tamped with a hammer and rubber mallet to ensure tight fit. There was noted to be distally increased range of motion after insertion of the implant. Attention was then directed to the first metatarsal. A long dorsal arm Austin osteotomy was then created. A second osteotomy was then created just plantar and parallel to the first osteotomy site. The wedge was then removed in toto. The area was feathered to ensure high compression of the osteotomy site. The head was noted to be in a more plantar flexed position. The capital fragment was then temporarily fixated with two 0.45 K-wires. A 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion. A second more proximal 2.7 x 60 mm screw was also inserted in a standard AO fashion. With both screws, there was noted to be tight compression at the osteotomy sites. The K-wires were removed and the areas were then smoothed with reciprocating rash. A screw driver was then used to check and ensure screw tightness. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. Subchondral drilling was performed with a 1.5 drill bit. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. Closure consisted of capsular closure with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by running subcuticular stitch of #5-0 Vicryl. Dressings consisted of Steri-Strips, Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. A total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected intraoperatively for further anesthesia. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well. The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin ES and instructed to take 1 q. 4-6h. p.o. p.r.n. pain. The patient was instructed to ice and elevate his left lower extremity as much as possible to help decrease postoperative edema. The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his office as directed.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Herniated nucleus pulposus C2-C3. 2. Spinal stenosis C3-C4. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Herniated nucleus pulposus C2-C3. 2. Spinal stenosis C3-C4. PROCEDURES 1. Anterior cervical discectomy, C3-C4, C2-C3. 2. Anterior cervical fusion, C2-C3, C3-C4. 3. Removal of old instrumentation, C4-C5. 4. Fusion C3-C4 and C2-C3 with instrumentation using ABC plates. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in the supine position. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy. A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3. Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate. We placed in self-retaining retractors. With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5. After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid. We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal. In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit. It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis. With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4. We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4. These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase. We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves. The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin. Blood loss was about 50 mL. No complication of the surgery. Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct. The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb. At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation. At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain. He does have degenerative changes at C5-C6, C6-C7, C7-T1; however, they do not appear to be symptomatic, although x-rays show the disks to be partially collapsed at all levels with osteophyte formation beginning to form.",FALSE
" CC: Paraplegia. HX: This 32 y/o RHF had been performing missionary work in Jos, Nigeria for several years and delivered her 4th child by vaginal delivery on 4/10/97. The delivery was induced with Pitocin, but was otherwise uncomplicated. For the first 4 days post-partum she noted clear liquid diarrhea without blood and minor abdominal discomfort. This spontaneous resolved without medical treatment. The second week post-partum she had 4-5 days of sinusitis, purulent nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise well until 5/4/97 when stationed in a more rural area of Nigeria, she noted a dull ache in both knees (lateral to the patellae) and proximal tibia, bilaterally. The pain was not relieved by massage and seemed more bothersome when seated or supine. She had no sensory loss at the time. On 5/6/97, she awakened to pain radiating down her knees to her anterior tibia. Over the next few hours the pain radiated circumferentially around both calves, and involved the soles of her feet and posterior BLE to her buttocks. Rising from bed became a laborious task and she required assistance to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen provided minimal analgesia. By evening the sole of one foot was numb. She awoke the next morning, 5/9/97, with &quot;pins & needles&quot; sensation in BLE up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for analgesia and took an airplane back to the larger city she was based in. During the one hour flight her BLE weakness progressed to a non-weight bearing state (i.e. she could not stand). Local evaluation revealed 3/3 proximal and 4/4 distal BLE weakness. She had a sensory level to her waist on PP and LT testing. She also had mild lumbar back pain. Local laboratory evaluation: WBC 12.7, ESR 10. She was presumed to have Guillain-Barre syndrome and was placed on Solu-Cortef 1000mg qd and Sandimmune IV IgG 12.0 g. On 5/10/97, she was airlifted to Geneva, Switzerland. Upon arrival there she had total anesthesia from the feet up to the inguinal region, bilaterally. There was flaccid areflexic paralysis of BLE and she was unable to void or defecate. Straight catheterization of the bladder revealed a residual volume of 1000cc. On 5/12/ CSF analysis revealed: Protein 1.5g/l, Glucose 2.2mmol/l, WBC 92 (O PMNS, 100% Lymphocytes), RBC 70, Clear CSF, bacterial-fungal-AFB-cultures were negative. Broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd were started. MRI T-L-spine, 5/12/97 revealed an intradural T12-L1 lesion that enhanced minimally with gadolinium and was associated with spinal cord edema in the affected area. MRI Brain, 5/12/97, was unremarkable and showed no evidence of demyelinating disease. HIV, HTLV-1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, Malaria and CMV serological titers were negative. On 5/15/97 the Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT serological titer returned positive at 1:320 (normal&lt;1:80). 5/12/97 CSF Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT and ELISA were negative. She was then given a one day course of Praziquantel 3.6g total in 3 doses; and started on Prednisone 60 mg po qd; the broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol were discontinued. On 5/22/97, a rectal biopsy was performed to evaluate parasite eradication. The result came back positive for ova and granulomata after she had left for UIHC. The organism was not speciated. 5/22/97 CSF schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers were positive at 1.09 and 1:160, respectively. These titers were not known when she initially arrived at UIHC. Following administration of Praziquantel, she regained some sensation in BLE but the paraplegia, and urinary retention remained. MEDS: On 5/24/97 UIHC arrival: Prednisone 60mg qd, Zantac 50 IV qd, Propulsid 20mg tid, Enoxaparin 20mg qd. PMH: 1)G4P4. FHX: unremarkable. SHX: Missionary. Married. 4 children ( ages 7,5,3,6 weeks).

COURSE: MRI T-L-spine, 5/24/97, revealed a 6 x 8 x 25 soft tissue mass at the L1 level posterior to the tip of the conus medullaris and extending into the canal below that level. This appeared to be intradural. There was mild enhancement. There was more enhancement along the distal cord surface and cauda equina. The distal cord had sign of diffuse edema. She underwent exploratory and decompressive laminectomy on 5/27/97, and was retreated with a one day course of Praziquantel 40mg/kg/day. Praziquantel is reportedly only 80% effective at parasite eradication. She continued to reside on the Neurology/Neurosurgical service on 5/31/97 and remained paraplegic.",FALSE
" TITLE OF OPERATION: 1. Diagnostic arthroscopy exam under anesthesia, left shoulder. 2. Debridement of chondral injury, left shoulder. 3. Debridement, superior glenoid, left shoulder. 4. Arthrotomy. 5. Bankart lesion repair. 6. Capsular shift, left shoulder (Mitek suture anchors; absorbable anchors with nonabsorbable sutures). INDICATION FOR SURGERY: The patient was seen multiple times preoperatively and found to have chronic instability of her shoulder. Risks and benefits of the procedure had been discussed in length including but not exclusive of infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, continued instability, recurrent instability, medical complications, surgical complications, and anesthesia complications. The patient understood and wishes to proceed. PREOP DIAGNOSIS: Anterior instability, left shoulder. POSTOP DIAGNOSES: 1. Anterior instability, left shoulder. 2. Grade 4 chondromalacia, 10% humeral head, chondral defect 1 cm squared, left shoulder. 3. Type 1 superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion, left shoulder. 4. Anteroinferior glenoid erosions 10% bony surface, left shoulder. 5. Bankart lesion, left shoulder. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in a supine position and both shoulders examined systematically. She had full range of motion with no joint adhesions. She had equal range of motion bilaterally. She had Hawkins 2 anteriorly and posteriorly in both shoulders with a grade 1 sulcus sign in both shoulders. This was the same when the arm was in neutral or in external rotation. The patient was then turned to right lateral decubitus position, axillary roll was placed, and beanbag was inflated. Peroneal nerve was well protected. All bony prominences were well protected. The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The patient was given antibiotics well before the start of the procedure to decrease the risk of infection. The arm was placed in a arm holder with 10 pounds of traction. A posterior portal was created in the usual manner by isolating gently with the spinal needle, it was insufflated with 30 cubic centimeters of saline. A small incision was made after infiltrating the skin with Marcaine and epinephrine. The scope was introduced into the shoulder with no difficulty. It was then examined systematically. The patient did have diffuse synovitis throughout her shoulder. Her posterior humeral head showed an enlarged bold spot with some other areas of chondromalacia on the posterior head. She also had an area 1 cm in diameter, which was on more central portion of the head and more inferiorly which appeared to be more of an impaction-type injury. This had some portions of fibrillated and loose cartilage, hanging from the edges. These were later debrided, but the dissection was proximally 10 to 15% of the humeral surface. The biceps tendon appeared to be normal. The supraspinatus, infraspinatus tendons were normal. The inferior pouch was normal with no capsular tearing and no HAGL lesions. The posteroinferior labrum was normal as well as the posterosuperior labrum. There was some fraying in the posterosuperior labrum, which was later debrided. It was found essentially to be a type 1 lesion anteriorly and superiorly. The anterosuperior labrum appeared to be detached, which appeared to be more consistent with a sublabral hole. The middle glenohumeral ligament was present as an entire sheath, but attach to the labrum. The labrum did appeared to be detached from the anterior glenoid from the 11 o'clock position all the way down to the 6 o'clock position. The biceps anchor itself was later probed and found to be stable and normal. The subscapularis tendon was normal. The anterior band of the glenohumeral ligament was present, but it was clearly avulsed off the glenoid. There was some suggestion of anteroinferior bony erosions, which was later substantiated when the shoulder was opened. The patient was missing about 10 to 15% of her anteroinferior glenoid rim. The patient had a positive drive-through sign. The arm was then moved to lateral and placed through range of motion. There was contact of the rotator cuff to the superior glenoid in flexion at 115 degrees, maximum flexion was 150 degrees. The arm abducted and externally rotated. There was contact to the rotator cuff with posterosuperior labrum. This occurred with the arm position of 90 degrees with abduction at 55 degrees of external rotation. It should be noted that the maximum abduction is 150 degrees and with the arm abducted 90 degrees, maximum external rotation was 95 degrees. The patient did have a positive relocation maneuver. The posterior labrum did appear to tilt-off, but did not appear to peel off. The arm was then placed back in the arm holder. Anterior portal was created with Wissinger rod. A blue cannula was inserted into the shoulder without difficulty. Shaver was introduced in the labrum. Also the area of chondromalacia as mentioned above was debrided. The labrum was found to be stable with only a type 1 SLAP lesion, and there was no evidence as there was really a type 2 SLAP lesion. The instruments were then removed along with excess fluid. The posterior portals were closed with single 4-0 nylon suture. The anterior portal was left open. The patient was then placed in a supine position, and the extremity was reprepped and draped in anticipation of performing open capsular shift. The patient's anterior incision made just lateral to the coracoid in the skin line. Mediolateral skin flaps were developed, and cephalic vein was identified and protected throughout the case. The interval was developed down the clavipectoral fascia. The conjoined tendon was retracted medially and the deltoid laterally. The patient's subscapularis was intact, and the subscapularis split was then made between the upper one half and lower one half in line with muscle fibers. The capsule could easily be detached from the muscle, and the interval developed very easily. A retractor was placed inferiorly to protect the axillary nerve. Then Gelpi retractor was used to hold the subscapularis split open. Next, an arthrotomy was made down at the 9 o'clock position. The labrum was identified and found to be attached all the way down to 6 o'clock position. The inferior flap was then created in a usual manner and tied with a 0 Vicryl suture. The patient's glenoid rim did have some erosion as mentioned above with some bone loss and flattening. This was debrided with the soft tissue. Three Mitek suture anchors were then placed into the glenoid rim right at the margin of articular cartilage to the scapular neck. These were absorbable anchors with nonabsorbable sutures. They had excellent fixation once they had been placed. Next, the capsular shift and Bankart repair were performed in the usual manner with the number 2 Ti-Cron sutures as an outside in and then inside out technique. This brought the capsule right up to the edge of the glenoid rim. With the arm in internal rotation and posterior pressure on the head, the capsule was then secured to the rim with no difficulty under direct visualization. The capsule did come right up into the joint as expected with this type of repair. The superior flap was then closed, the inferior flap over the superior anchor. The interval between two flaps was closed with multiple number 2 Ti-Cron sutures. Once this has been completed, there was no tension on the repair with the arm to side until 10 degrees of external rotation was reached. The arm abducted 90 degrees. There was tension on the repair until 20 degrees of external rotation reached. The wound was thoroughly irrigated throughout with antibiotic-impregnated irrigation. The subscapularis split was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures. The deep subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures. The superficial subcutaneous tissues were closed with number 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with 4-0 subcuticular Prolene, reinforced with Steri-Strips. A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and a shoulder immobilizer. The patient was sent to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fractured right fifth metatarsal. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fractured right fifth metatarsal. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Open reduction and internal screw fixation right fifth metatarsal. 2. Application of short leg splint. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 32-year-old female presents to Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for open reduction and internal fixation of a fractured right fifth metatarsal. The patient relates that approximately in mid-June that she was working as a machinist at Detroit Diesel and dropped a large set of tools on her right foot. She continued to walk on the foot and found nothing was wrong despite the pain. She was recently seen by Dr. X and was referred to Dr. Y for surgery. The risks versus benefits of the procedure had been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. Y. The consent is available on the chart for review. The urine beta was taken in the preoperative area and was negative. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position. A safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection. Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied. After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to perform an infiltrative type block to the right fifth metatarsal area of the right foot. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered in the operative field and a sterile stocking was reflected. Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal base. The Xi-scan and fluoroscopic unit was used to visualize the fractured fifth metatarsal. An avulsion fracture of the right fifth metatarsal base was visualized. The fracture was linear in nature from distal lateral to proximal medial. There appeared to be a pseudoarthrosis on the lateral view. A skin scrub was used to carefully mark out all the landmarks including the peroneus longus and brevis tendons in the fifth metatarsal and the sural nerve. A linear incision was created with a #10 blade. A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue. All small veins traversing the subcutaneous tissue were ligated with electrocautery. Next, using combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the deep fascia was reached. Next a linear capsuloperiosteal incision was made down to the bone using a #15 blade. Next, using a periosteal elevator and a #15 blade, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were stripped from the bone. The fracture site was not clearly visualized due to bony callus. A #25 gauge needle was introduced into the fracture site under fluoroscopy. The fracture site was easily found. An osteotome was used to separate the pseudoarthrosis. A curette was used to remove the hypertrophic excessive pseudoarthrotic bone. Next, a small ball burr was used to resect the remaining hypertrophic bone. Next, a #1.0 drill bit was used to drill the subchondral bone on either side of the fracture site and a good healthy bleeding bone. Next, a bone clamp was applied and the fracture was reduced. Next, a threaded K-wire was thrown from the proximal base of the fifth metatarsal across the fracture site distally. A #4-0 mm Synthes partially threaded, cannulated 50 mm screw was thrown using standard AO technique from the proximal fifth metatarsal base down the shaft and the fracture site was fixated rigidly. All this was done under fluoroscopy. Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The fracture site was found to have rigid compression. The hypertrophic bone on the lateral aspect of the metatarsal was reduced with a ball burr and the wound was again flushed. Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion. A few fibers of the peroneus brevis tendon that were stripped from the base of the proximal phalanx were reattached carefully with Vicryl. Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted suture technique. Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Prolene in a horizontal mattress technique. A postoperative fluoroscopic x-ray was taken and the bony alignment was found to be intact and the screw placement had excellent appearance. A dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4x4s, fluff, and Kerlix were applied. A sterile stockinet was applied over the foot. Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied to pad all bony prominences. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits. Next, 4-inch, pre-moulded, well-padded posterior splint was applied. The capillary refill time of the digits was less than three seconds. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. After anesthesia was reversed, she was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. She was given Vicodin 5/500 mg #30 1-2 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain, Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c., Keflex 500 mg #30 one p.o. t.i.d., till gone. She was given standard postoperative instructions to be non-weightbearing and was dispensed with crutches. She will rest, ice, and elevate her right leg.

RADIOLOGY (CX SPINE): Films of the relevant radiologic studies of the cervical spine were reviewed: Cervical MRI scan (1/15/2001). There is loss of cervical lordosis and straightening of the cervical spine. There is no apparent intervertebral disc protrusion. RADIOLOGY (TLS SPINE): Films of the relevant lumbar neuroradiologic procedures were reviewed: Lumbar MRI scan (1/15/2001). The study is unremarkable. The lumbar lordosis is well-maintained. ASSESSMENT: S/P vehicular trauma 1/15/2001. Low Back syndrome (724.2). Cervicalgia (723.1). COMMENTS: The clinical picture and neurodiagnostic studies indicate that the patient has sustained significant injuries as a direct result of vehicular trauma. There is no indication for surgical intervention. Continued chiropractic treatment should be of benefit, with an emphasis on soft tissue techniques and mobilization. Physiatry consultation may be considered. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient was advised to gradually and progressively increase activity levels, as tolerated, while continuing to avoid anything unduly strenuous.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical disk protrusions at C5-C6 and C6-C7, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical pain. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical disk protrusions at C5-C6 and C6-C7, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical pain. PROCEDURES: C5-C6 and C6-C7 anterior cervical discectomy (two levels) C5-C6 and C6-C7 allograft fusions. A C5-C7 anterior cervical plate fixation (Sofamor Danek titanium window plate) intraoperative fluoroscopy used and intraoperative microscopy used. Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy. After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees. A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support. The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle. In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done. Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly. Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy. Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly. A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint. On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect. This was done under the microscope. A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus. A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level. This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen. Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released. Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right. This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots. With this done, the wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation. Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites. Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed. A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7. The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7. With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down. A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site. Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling. In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure. The patient remained stable throughout the procedure.",FALSE
" ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture. SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: None. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008. Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident. He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters. The patient denies any loss of consciousness. He was not amnestic to the event. He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated. Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation. HOSPITAL COURSE: Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture. No other apparent injuries. This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment. The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture. The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture. In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture. In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures. Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse. The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture. A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring. His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication. The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident. A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point. Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed. The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed. His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound. He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor. Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries. However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity. Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia. There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion. There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand. By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well. He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies. He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge. PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION: 1. Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008). 2. Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008). 3. Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008). 4. Irrigation and debridement of left elbow fracture (July 26, 2008). 5. CT of the brain without contrast (July 24, 2008). DISPOSITION: Home with parents. INVASIVE LINES: None. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed that he can return home with his regular diet and he was asked not to do any strenuous activities, move furniture, lift heavy objects, or use his left upper extremity. He was asked to followup with return appointment in one week to see Dr. Y in Orthopedics. Additionally, he was told to call his pediatrician, if he develops any fevers, pain, loss of sensation, loss of pulse, or discoloration of his fingers, or paleness to his hand.",FALSE

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe neurologic or neurogenic scoliosis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe neurologic or neurogenic scoliosis. PROCEDURES: 1. Anterior spine fusion from T11-L3. 2. Posterior spine fusion from T3-L5. 3. Posterior spine segmental instrumentation from T3-L5, placement of morcellized autograft and allograft. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 500 mL. FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a severe scoliosis. This was found to be moderately corrected. Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy. INDICATIONS: The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis. He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression. Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits. They wished to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. General anesthesia was induced without incident. He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics. Appropriate lines were then placed. He had a neuromonitoring performed as well. He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up. An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib. Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision. The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed. The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later. The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally. This allowed for entry into the pleural space. The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap. The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine. Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies. This required cauterization of the segmental vessels. Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed. These were performed from T11-L3. This was over 5 levels. Disks and endplates were then removed. Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces. The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine. This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature. The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity. The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures. Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well. Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl. This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape. The patient was then rotated into a prone position. The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion. Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5. The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision. Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis. The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split. This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes. Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine. These were placed at L4 and L5. The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum. This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur. Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft. Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed. These were placed from L3-T3. Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned. This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side. The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine. This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature. Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin. This was done using pulsed lavage. The wound was then closed in layers. The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed. The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition. All instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient will be managed in the ICU and then on the floor as indicated.",FALSE
" CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left wrist pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT PROBLEM: The patient has a previous history of a left traumatic wrist injury, which has left him with a chronic scapholunate problem and possibly other problems in his wrist. However, he was doing relatively fine and tolerating the wrist soreness that he had, which is day to day, but it has not gotten much worse until this injury. Once he lifted the object out of the back of his car and it started to hurt, then he was significantly more affected than he was before, and now pain is more on the ulnar side of his wrist than on the radial side of his wrist. He is here now for evaluation. CLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Musculoskeletal: The patient has point tenderness to palpation along the ulnar styloid ECU ridge with some minor tenderness at the TFC region, as well as the lunotriquetral joint. There is some minor soreness, but not nearly as sore at the SL ligament with dorsiflexion 30&deg;, palmar flexion 30&deg;, radial deviation 5&deg; and ulnar deviation 0&deg;. Supination/pronation grossly intact without significant signs of instability. Negative piano key sign compared to the contralateral side. Skin: No skin breakdown or hyperhidrosis. Neurologic: Negative signs of compressive median nerve neuropathy. Vascular: Intact. RADIOLOGICAL/LABORATORY EXAM: X-rays, three views of the wrist of good penetrance and quality, reveal scapholunate widening of a slack wrist with a possible ulnar styloid nonunion, with a possible occult distal radius fracture fibrous union. MRI report reviewed. EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN: The MRI is consistent with edema and swelling in the ulnar styloid region, which is consistent with the injury pattern that he is claiming and where he is most sore. He has a chronic problem that needs to potentially be addressed. Sometimes with these acute on chronic problems, what was tolerated initially may no longer be tolerated by the patient, which we talked about. Our focus still should be on the initial injury which brought him in at this time. It is a three-week-old injury. Given the MRI, we probably have seen on radiographs a fibrous union between that ulnar styloid and the remaining portion of the ulna, which may have been torn or injured, especially consistent with the MRI. Therefore, I would cast him initially to get that to heal, and then reassess. All questions were answered, and we will make the treatment plans accordingly. He will followup in two weeks. We casted him.",FALSE
" SUBJECTIVE: The patient comes back to see me today. She is a pleasant 77-year-old Caucasian female who had seen Dr. XYZ with right leg pain. She has a history of prior laminectomy for spinal stenosis. She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic. Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005. She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip. An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study. Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005. She was last seen on 04/15/2005. At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain. She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement. We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines. The patient comes back to see me today. She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement. She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her. She is taking Ultracet or other the generic it sounds like, up to four times daily. She states she can take this much more frequently as she still has significant pain symptoms. She is using a cane to help her ambulate. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essentially unchanged from her visit of 04/15/2005. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: Reveals a pleasant Caucasian female. Vital Signs: Height is 5 feet 4 inches. Weight is 149 pounds. She is afebrile. HEENT: Benign. Neck: Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's. Musculoskeletal: Examination shows some mild degenerative joint disease of both knees with grade weakness of her right hip flexors and half-grade weakness of her right hip adductors and right quadriceps, as compared to the left. Straight leg raises are negative bilaterally. Posterior tibials are palpable bilaterally. Skin and Lymphatics: Examination of the skin does not reveal any additional scars, rashes, cafe au lait spots or ulcers. No significant lymphadenopathy noted. Spine: Examination shows lumbar scoliosis with surgical scar with no major tenderness. Spinal movements are limited but functional. Neurological: She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect. She has normal tone and coordination. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Sensations are intact to pinprick. FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it. IMPRESSION: 1. Degenerative disk disease of the right hip, symptomatic. 2. Low back syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, clinically right L2 radiculopathy, stable. 3. Low back pain with lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, stable. 4. Facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right, stable. 5. Post left hip arthroplasty. 6. Chronic pain syndrome. RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient is symptomatic primarily on her right hip and is planning on seeing an orthopedic surgeon for possible right hip replacement. In the interim, her Ultracet is not quite taking care of her pain. I have asked her to discontinue it and we will start her on Tylenol #3, up to four times a day. I have written a prescription for this for 120 tablets and two refills. The patient will call for the refills when she needs them. I will plan further follow up in six months, sooner if needed. She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan. Physical exam findings, history of present illness and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Goel's findings.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with possible pseudoarthrosis at C4-C5. 2. Cervical radiculopathy involving the left arm. 3. Disc degeneration at C3-C4 and C6-C7. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with possible pseudoarthrosis at C4-C5. 2. Cervical radiculopathy involving the left arm. 3. Disc degeneration at C3-C4 and C6-C7. OPERATIVE PROCEDURES 1. Decompressive left lumbar laminectomy C4-C5 and C5-C6 with neural foraminotomy. 2. Posterior cervical fusion C4-C5. 3. Songer wire. 4. Right iliac bone graft. TECHNIQUE: The patient was brought to the operating room. Preoperative evaluations included previous cervical spine surgery. The patient initially had some relief; however, his left arm pain did recur and gradually got worse. Repeat studies including myelogram and postspinal CTs revealed some blunting of the nerve root at C4-C5 and C5-C6. There was also noted to be some annular bulges at C3-C4, and C6-C7. The CT scan in March revealed that the fusion was not fully solid. X-rays were done in November including flexion and extension views, it appeared that the fusion was solid. The patient had been on pain medication. The patient had undergone several nonoperative treatments. He was given the option of surgical intervention. We discussed Botox, I discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression. I explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck, and that no guarantee would help, there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it was from the anterior surgery. If at the time of surgery there was some motion of the C4-C5 level, I would recommend a fusion. The patient was a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but has not quit smoking. I have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft. I explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life. Even if this type of bone graft was used, there was no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completely. The patient also was advised that if I did a fusion, I would also use post instrumentation, which was a wire. The wire would be left permanently. Even with all these procedures, there was no guarantee that his symptoms would improve. His numbness, tingling, and weakness could get worse rather than better, his neck pain and arm pain could persist. He still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure. Other procedures may be necessary later. There is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function. He could lose total control of his arms or legs and end up in the bed for the rest of his life. He could develop chronic regional pain syndromes. He could get difficulty swallowing or eating. He could have substantial weakness in the arm. He was advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent, severe, and unremitting. He was also offered his records if he would like any other pain medications or seek other treatments, he was advised that Dr. X would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgery. He stated he understood all the risks. He did not wish to get any other treatments. He said the pain has reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgery. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: In the operating room, he was given general endotracheal anesthesia. I then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic rolls. His head was controlled by a horseshoe holder. The anesthesiologist checked the eye positions to make sure there was no pressure on the orbits and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minutes. The arms, the right hip, and the neck was then prepped and draped. Care was taken to position both arms and both legs. Pulses were checked. A midline incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine. A loupe magnification and headlamp illumination was used. Bleeding vessels were cauterized. Meticulous hemostasis was carried out throughout the procedure. Gradually and carefully I exposed the spinous process of the C6, C5, and C4. A lateral view was done after an instrument in place. This revealed the C6-C7 level. I therefore did a small laminotomy opening at C4-C5. I placed an instrument and x-rays confirmed C4-C5 level. I stripped the muscles from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a self-retaining retractor. Once I identified the level, I then used a bur to thin the lamina of C5. I used a 1-mm, followed by a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off C5 on the left. I removed some of the superior lamina of C6 and some of the inferior lamina of C4. This allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve roots and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the C5 and C6 nerve roots. There was some bleeding from the epidural veins and a bipolar cautery was used. Absolutely no retractors were ever placed in the canal. There was no retraction. I was able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc spaces to make sure there was no fragments of disc or herniation disc and none were found. At the end of the procedure, the neuroforamen were widely patent. The nerve roots had been fully decompressed. I then checked stability. There was micromotion at the C4-C5 level. I therefore elected to proceed with a fusion. I debrided the interspinous ligament between C4 and C5. I used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of C5 and the inferior portion of C4. Using a small drill, I opened the facet at C4-C5. I then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage. I used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at C4-C5. Attention was turned to the right and left hip, which was also prepped. An incision made over the iliac crest. Bleeding vessels were cauterized. I exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest. I removed some of the bone and then used the curette to remove cancellous bone. I placed the Songer wire through the base of the spinous process of C4 and C5. Drill holes made with a clip. I then packed cancellous bone between the decorticated spinous process. I then tightened the Songer wire to the appropriate tension and then cut off the excess wire. Prior to tightening the wire, I also packed cancellous bone with facet at C4-C5. I then laid bone upon the decorticated lamina of C4 and C5. The hip wound was irrigated with bacitracin and Kantrex. Deep structures were closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous suture and subcuticular tissue was closed. No drain was placed in the hip. A drain was left in the posterior cervical spine. The deep tissues were closed with 0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue and skin were then closed. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.",FALSE
" MM/DD/YYYY XYZ, D.C. Re: ABC Dear Dr. XYZ: I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, ABC, today MM/DD/YYYY in consultation. He is an unfortunate 19-year-old right-handed male who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY, where he was the driver of an automobile, which was struck on the front passenger's side. The patient sustained impact injuries to his neck and lower back. There was no apparent head injury or loss of consciousness and he denied any posttraumatic seizures. He was taken to Hospital, x-rays were taken, apparently which were negative and he was released. At the present time, he complains of neck and lower back pain radiating into his right arm and right leg with weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in his right arm and right leg. He has had no difficulty with bowel or bladder function. He does experience intermittent headaches associated with his neck pain with no other associated symptoms. PAST HEALTH: He was injured in a prior motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY. At the time of his most recent injuries, he was completely symptom free and under no active therapy. There is no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, neurological disorders, ulcers or tuberculosis. SOCIAL HISTORY: He denies tobacco or alcohol consumption. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: None. FAMILY HISTORY: Otherwise noncontributory. FUNCTIONAL INQUIRY: Otherwise noncontributory. REVIEW OF DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Includes an MRI scan of the cervical spine dated MM/DD/YYYY which showed evidence for disc bulging at the C6-C7 level. MRI scan of the lumbar spine on MM/DD/YYYY, showed evidence of a disc herniation at the L1-L2 level as well as a disc protrusion at the L2-L3 level with disc herniations at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 level and disc protrusion at the L5-S1 level. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals an alert and oriented male with normal language function. Vital Signs: Blood pressure was 105/68 in the left arm sitting. Heart rate was 70 and regular. Height was 5 feet 8 inches. Weight was 182 pounds. Cranial nerve evaluation was unremarkable. Pupils were equal and reactive. Funduscopic evaluation was clear. There was no evidence for nystagmus. There was decreased range of motion noted in both the cervical and lumbar regions to a significant degree, with tenderness and spasm in the paraspinal musculature. Straight leg raising was limited to 45 degrees on the right and 90 degrees on the left. Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale. Reflexes were 2+ symmetrical and active. No pathological responses were noted. Sensory examination showed a diffuse decreased sensation to pinprick in the right upper extremity. Cerebellar function was normal. There was normal station and gait. Chest and cardiovascular evaluations were unremarkable. Heart sounds were normal. There were no extra sounds or murmurs. Palpable trigger points were noted in the right trapezius and right cervical and lumbar paraspinal musculature. CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Reveals a 19-year-old male suffering from a posttraumatic cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, secondary to traumatic injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY. In view of the persistent radicular complaints associated with the weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling as well as the objective sensory loss noted on today's evaluation as well as the non-specific nature of the radiculopathy, I have scheduled him for an EMG study on his right upper and right lower extremity in two week's time to rule out any nerve root irritation versus any peripheral nerve entrapment or plexopathy as the cause of his symptoms. Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation. He is suffering from ongoing myofascitis. His treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections to be initiated at his next follow up visit in two weeks' time. I have encouraged him to continue with his ongoing treatment program under your care and supervision. I will be following him in two weeks' time. Once again, thank you kindly for allowing me to participate in this patient's care and management. Yours sincerely,",FALSE

Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation from C3 to C6 using a Synthes Small Stature Plate, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This 62-year-old man has severe cervical spondylosis with myelopathy and cord compression at C5-C6. There was a herniated disk with cord compression and radiculopathy at C4-C5. C3-C4 was the source of neck pain as documented by facet injections. A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the pros and cons of the surgery by two levels versus three levels. Because of the severe component of the neck pain that has been relieved with facet injections, we elected to proceed ahead with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. I explained the nature of this procedure in great detail including all risks and alternatives. He clearly understands and has no further questions and requests that I proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated taking great care to keep the neck in a neutral position. The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion dosages. The left side of the neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A transverse incision was made in the neck crease. Dissection was carried down through the platysma musculature and the anterior spine was exposed. The medial borders of the longus colli muscle were dissected free from their attachments to the spine. Caspar self-retaining pins were placed into the bodies of C3, C4, C5, and C6 and x-ray localization was obtained. A needle was placed in what was revealed to be the disk space at C4-C5 and an x-ray confirmed proper localization. Self-retaining retractors were then placed in the wound, taking great care to keep the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles. First I removed the large amount of anterior overhanging osteophytes at C5-C6 and distracted the space. The high-speed cutting bur was used to drill back the osteophytes towards the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies. An incision was then made at C4-C5 and the annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies. The retractors were then adjusted and again discectomy was performed at C3-C4 back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies. The operating microscope was then utilized. Working under magnification, I started at C3-C4 and began to work my way down to the posterior longitudinal ligament. The ligament was incised and the underlying dura was exposed. I worked out laterally towards the takeoff of the C4 nerve root and widely decompressed the nerve root edge of the foramen. There were a large number of veins overlying the nerve root which were oozing and rather than remove these and produce tremendous amount of bleeding, I left them intact. However, I could to palpate the nerve root along the pedicle into the foramen and widely decompressed it on the right. The microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved. The retractors were readjusted and attention was turned to C4-C5. I worked down through bony osteophytes and identified the posterior longitudinal ligament. The ligament was incised; and as I worked to the right of the midline, I encountered herniated disk material which was removed in a number of large pieces. The C5 root was exposed and then widely decompressed until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen. The root had a somewhat high takeoff but I worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it. Again the microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved. Central decompression was achieved here where there was a moderate amount of spinal cord compression. This was removed by undercutting with 1 and 2-mm Cloward punches. Attention was then turned to the C5-C6 space. Here there were large osteophytes projecting posteriorly against the cord. I slowly and carefully used the high-speed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2-mm Cloward punches to widely decompress the spinal cord. This necessitated undercutting the bodies of both C5 and C6 extensively, but I was then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord. I exposed the C6 root and widely decompressed it until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right. The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar decompression was achieved. Attention was then turned to creation of the arthrodesis. A high-speed Cornerstone bur was used to decorticate the bodies of C5-C6, C4-C5 and C3-C4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration. Bone dust during the drilling was harvested for later use. Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis. Using the various Synthes sizers, I selected a 7-mm lordotic graft at C5-C6 and an 8-mm lordotic graft at C4-C5 and a 9-mm lordotic graft at C3-C4. Each graft was filled with autologous bone from the vertebral bodies and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge. I decided to use BMP in this case because there were three levels of fusion and because this patient has a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two weeks. The BMP sponge and the ____________ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft. Under distraction, the graft was placed at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 as described. An x-ray was obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis. Attention was turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation. Various sizes of Synthes plates were selected until I decided that a 54-mm plate was appropriate. The plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral bodies had to be drilled so that the plates would sit flush. The holes were drilled and the screws were placed. Eight screws were placed with two screws at C3, two screws at C4, two screws at C5, and two screws at C6. All eight screws had good purchase. The locking screws were tightly applied. An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of the graft, plate, and screws. Attention was turned to closure. The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis was obtained. A medium Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin. The wound was then carefully closed in layers. Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation. PROCEDURES: 1. Open reduction internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture with placement in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint. 2. Closed reduction casting of the right forearm. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine. TOURNIQUET TIME: On the left was 29 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: There were no intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today. The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow. After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure. Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve. At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced. This was explained to the father. The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms. All questions were answered. The father agreed to the above plan. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful. It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction. The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg. The Esmarch was then removed. An incision was then made. Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve. The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint. This was easily removed. The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact. The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place. After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform. The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine. The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation. The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding. Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed. The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition.

BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. FINDINGS: Thickened transverse carpal ligament and partially subluxed ulnar nerve. SUMMARY: After informed consent was obtained and verified, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, his right arm was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion. After elevation and exsanguination with an Esmarch, the tourniquet was inflated. The carpal tunnel was performed first with longitudinal incision in the palm carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The palmar fascia was divided exposing the transverse carpal ligament, which was incised longitudinally. A Freer was then inserted beneath the ligament, and dissection was carried out proximally and distally. After adequate release has been formed, the wound was irrigated and closed with nylon. The medial approach to the elbow was then performed and the skin was opened and subcutaneous tissues were dissected. A medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified and protected throughout the case. The ulnar nerve was noted to be subluxing over the superior aspect of the medial epicondyle and flattened and inflamed. The ulnar nerve was freed proximally and distally. The medial intramuscular septum was excised and the flexor carpi ulnaris fascia was divided. The intraarticular branch and the first branch to the SCU were transected; and then the nerve was transposed, it did not appear to have any significant tension or sharp turns. The fascial sling was made from the medial epicondyle and sewn to the subcutaneous tissues and the nerve had good translation with flexion and extension of the elbow and not too tight. The wound was irrigated. The tourniquet was deflated and the wound had excellent hemostasis. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples. Prior to the tourniquet being deflated, the subcutaneous dissection was carried out over to the olecranon bursa, where the loose fragments were excised with a rongeurs as well as abrading the ulnar cortex and excision of hypertrophic bursa. A posterior splint was applied. Marcaine was injected into the incisions and the splint was reinforced with tape. He was awakened from the anesthesia and taken to recovery room in a stable condition.

" The patient is a 64-year-old sales woman who is referred to our office for severe chronic back pain, hip pain, and pain in her knees as well as her neck. She states that she cannot remember when it started and she has had back pain and knee pain for years but most recently it has gotten &quot;intolerable.&quot; She states that she has had many problems with her neck over the years, pictures taken in the late 1990s, but no treatment. She had headaches, which were treated with antidepressants and Fiorinal, which helped her quite a bit. She states that she was also married to a wife beater and suffered many episodes of severe beatings when she was younger. She complains of back pain that radiates around her right hip and into the anterior thigh as well as bilateral knee pain. She states that her pain is constant. On a 1 to 10 pain scale, she rates it between a 6 and a 10. She has tried Fiorinal, which helps with her headaches. Currently, she is doing physical therapy for her back. She has also seen several different chiropractors over the years. On the body image drawing, she draws posterior neck pain, head pain, and right shoulder pain. She also draws numbness and tingling in her right hand. She draws pain in her back going into the right hip and down the anterior aspect of the right leg and bilateral knee pain. She states that her back hurts her more than her legs. When it comes to her legs, her right is worse than left. Knee pain is worse on the left than on the right. She is unable to identify any alleviating factors. Walking, standing, sitting, lying down, coughing, sneezing, working, and light and heavy exercise exacerbate her pain. Bowel movements make no difference in her pain. She describes pain as being 70% in the low back, 15% in the right leg, 15% in right buttock, and 50% in the left knee. She states that she can no longer bend her knee completely and her back pain is so severe that at times she cannot move. If she bends over it feels like someone has hit her in the back.

FINDINGS: The patient brings in lumbar spine MRI dated November 20, 2007, which demonstrates degenerative disc disease throughout. At L4-L5, there is an annular disc bulge with fissuring with facet arthrosis and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy yielding moderate central stenosis and neuroforaminal narrowing but the nerves do not appear to be impinged. At L5-S1, in the right neuroforamina, there appears to be soft tissue density just lateral and posterior to the nerve root, which may cause some displacement, but it is unclear. This could represent a facet synovial cyst. This is lateral to the facet. She does not have x-rays for review. She has had hip and knee x-rays taken but does not bring them in with her. ASSESSMENT: Low back pain, lumbar radiculopathy, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, history of anemia, high cholesterol, and hypothyroidism. PLAN: We discussed treatment options with this patient including: 1 Do nothing. 2. Conservative therapies. 3. Surgery. She seems to have some issues with her right hip, so I would like for her to fax us over the report of her hip and knee x-rays. We will also order some x-rays of her lumbar spine as well as lower extremity EMG. At this point, the patient has not exhausted conservative measures and would like to start with epidural steroid injections, so we will go ahead and send her out for that. After she has gotten her second epidural injection, she will return to the office for a followup visit to see how she is doing. All questions and concerns were addressed. If she should have any further questions, concerns, or complications, she will contact our office immediately. Otherwise, we will see her as scheduled.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hip osteoarthritis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hip osteoarthritis. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Total hip replacement on the right side using the following components: 1. Zimmer trilogy acetabular system 10-degree elevated rim located at the 12 o'clock position. 2. Trabecular metal modular acetabular system 48 mm in diameter. 3. Femoral head 32 mm diameter +0 mm neck length. 4. Alloclassic SL offset stem uncemented for taper. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the operating room and was placed on the operative table in a lateral decubitus position with the right side up. After review of allergies, antibiotics were administered and time out was performed. The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A 15 cm to 25 cm in length, an incision was made over the greater trochanter. This was angled posteriorly. Access to the tensor fascia lata was performed. This was incised with the use of scissors. Gluteus maximus was separated. The bursa around the hip was identified, and the bleeders were coagulated with the use of Bovie. Hemostasis was achieved. The piriformis fossa was identified, and the piriformis fossa tendon was elevated with the use of a Cobb. It was detached from the piriformis fossa and tagged with 2-0 Vicryl. Access to the capsule was performed. The capsule was excised from the posterior and superior aspects. It was released also in the front with the use of a Mayo scissors. The hip was then dislocated. With the use of an oscillating saw, the femoral neck cut was performed. The acetabulum was then visualized and debrided from soft tissues and osteophytes. Reaming was initiated and completed for a 48 mm diameter cap without complications. The trial component was put in place and was found to be stable in an anatomic position. The actual component was then impacted in the acetabulum. A 10-degree lip polyethylene was also placed in the acetabular cap. Our attention was then focused to the femur. With the use of a cookie cutter, the femoral canal was accessed. The broaching process was initiated for No.4 trial component. Trialing of the hip with the hip flexed at 90 degrees and internally rotated to 30 degrees did not demonstrate any obvious instability or dislocation. In addition, in full extension and external rotation, there was no dislocation. The actual component was inserted in place and hemostasis was achieved again. The wound was irrigated with normal saline. The wound was then closed in layers. Before performing that the medium-sized Hemovac drain was placed in the wound. The tensor fascia lata was closed with 0 PDS and the wound was closed with 2-0 Monocryl. Staples were used for the skin. The patient recovered from anesthesia without complications. EBL: 50 mL. IV FLUIDS: 2 liters. DRAINS: One medium-sized Hemovac. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. She will be weightbearing as tolerated to the right lower extremity with posterior hip precautions. We will start the DVT prophylaxis after the removal of the epidural catheter.",FALSE
" REASON FOR VISIT: Followup cervical spinal stenosis. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis. I have last seen her on 06/19/07. Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects. I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI. She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck. She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain. The right hand weakness continues. She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity. She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her. She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms. She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction. No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath. FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x3. Normocephalic and atraumatic. Afebrile to touch. She ambulates with a normal gait. Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion. Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution. Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 3 plus. Hoffman sign normal bilaterally. Lower extremity strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups. Patellar reflex is 3 plus. No clonus. Cervical spine radiographs dated 06/21/07 are reviewed. They demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease. There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views. Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed. It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6. These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level. Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7. This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5. Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness. I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options. I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions. The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done. I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness. She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention. I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model. I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain. She understands. I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient's relatively young age. Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies. I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty. She understands. She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon. She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then. Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07. She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process.",FALSE
" HISTORY: We had the pleasure of seeing the patient today in our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic. He was sent here with a chief complaint of joint pain in several joints for few months. This is a 7-year-old white male who has no history of systemic disease, who until 2 months ago, was doing well and 2 months ago, he started to complain of pain in his fingers, elbows, and neck. At this moment, this is better and is almost gone, but for several months, he was having pain to the point that he would cry at some point. He is not a complainer according to his mom and he is a very active kid. There is no history of previous illness to this or had gastrointestinal problems. He has problems with allergies, especially seasonal allergies and he takes Claritin for it. Other than that, he has not had any other problem. Denies any swelling except for that doctor mentioned swelling on his elbow. There is no history of rash, no stomach pain, no diarrhea, no fevers, no weight loss, no ulcers in his mouth except for canker sores. No lymphadenopathy, no eye problems, and no urinary problems. MEDICATIONS: His medications consist only of Motrin only as needed and Claritin currently for seasonal allergies and rhinitis. ALLERGIES: He has no allergies to any drugs. BIRTH HISTORY: Pregnancy and delivery with no complications. He has no history of hospitalizations or surgeries. FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for arthritis in his grandmother. No history of pediatric arthritis. There is history of psoriasis in his dad. SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with mom, dad, brother, sister, and everybody is healthy. They live in Easton. They have 4 dogs, 3 cats, 3 mules and no deer. At school, he is in second grade and he is doing PE without any limitation. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature is 98.7, pulse is 96, respiratory rate is 24, height is 118.1 cm, weight is 22.1 kg, and blood pressure is 61/44. GENERAL: He is alert, active, in no distress, very cooperative. HEENT: He has no facial rash. No lymphadenopathy. Oral mucosa is clear. No tonsillitis. His ear canals are clear and pupils are reactive to light and accommodation. CHEST: Clear to auscultation. HEART: Regular rhythm and no murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender with no visceromegaly. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Shows no limitation in any of his joints or active swelling today. He has no tenderness either in any of his joints. Muscle strength is 5/5 in proximal muscles. LABORATORY DATA: Includes an arthritis panel. It has normal uric acid, sedimentation rate of 2, rheumatoid factor of 6, and antinuclear antibody that is negative and C-reactive protein that is 7.1. His mother stated that this was done while he was having symptoms. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This patient may have had reactive arthritis. He is seen frequently and the patient has family history of psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis. I do not see any problems at this moment on his laboratories or on his physical examination. This may have been related to recent episode of viral infection or infection of some sort. Mother was oriented about the finding and my recommendation is to observe him and if there is any recurrence of the symptoms or persistence of swelling or limitation in any of his joints, I will be glad to see him back.

" TITLE OF OPERATION: Lateral and plantar condylectomy, fifth left metatarsal. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prominent, lateral, and plantar condyle hypertrophy, fifth left metatarsal. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prominent, lateral, and plantar condyle hypertrophy, fifth left metatarsal. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with 10 mL of 1:1 mixture of both 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain. HEMOSTASIS: 30 minutes, left ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. MATERIALS USED: 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl. INJECTABLES: Ancef 1 g IV 30 minutes preoperatively. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position. After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites. The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg. The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique. The left ankle tourniquet was inflated. Attention was then directed on the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 4-cm linear incision was placed over the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and lateral to the course of the extensor digitorum longus to the fifth left toe. The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint. All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the soft tissue attachments through the fifth left metatarsal head were mobilized. The lateral and plantar aspect of the fifth left metatarsal head were adequately exposed and using the sagittal saw a lateral and plantar condylectomy of the fifth left metatarsal head were then achieved. The bony prominences were removed and passed off the operating table to be sent to pathology for identification. The remaining sharp edges of the fifth left metatarsal head were then smoothened with the use of a dental rasp. The area was copiously flushed with saline. Then, 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl suture materials were used to approximate the periosteal, capsular, and subcutaneous tissues respectively. The incision was reinforced with Steri-Strips. Range of motion of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint was tested and was found to be excellent and uninhibited. The patient's left ankle tourniquet at this time was deflated. Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff. The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage and the patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe. The patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels. The patient was given pain medications and instructions on how to control her postoperative course. She was discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was will follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal radius fracture, metaphyseal extraarticular. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal radius fracture, metaphyseal extraarticular. PROCEDURE: Open reduction and internal fixation of left distal radius. IMPLANTS: Wright Medical Micronail size 2. ANESTHESIA: LMA. TOURNIQUET TIME: 49 minutes. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. PATHOLOGY: None. TIME OUT: Time out was performed before the procedure started. INDICATIONS: The patient was a 42-year-old female who fell and sustained a displaced left metaphyseal distal radius fracture indicated for osteosynthesis. The patient was in early stage of gestation. Benefits and risks including radiation exposure were discussed with the patient and consulted her primary care doctor. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Supine position, LMA anesthesia, well-padded arm, tourniquet, Hibiclens, alcohol prep, and sterile drape. Exsanguination achieved, tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. First, under fluoroscopy the fracture was reduced. A 0.045 K-wire was inserted from dorsal ulnar corner of the distal radius and crossing fracture line to maintain the reduction. A 2-cm radial incision, superficial radial nerve was exposed and protected. Dissecting between the first and second dorsal extensor retinaculum, the second dorsal extensor compartment was elevated off from the distal radius. The guidewire was inserted under fluoroscopy. A cannulated drill was used to drill antral hole. Antral awl was inserted. Then we reamed the canal to size 2. Size 2 Micronail was inserted to the medullary canal. Using distal locking guide, three locking screws were inserted distally. The second dorsal incision was made. The deep radial dorsal surface was exposed. Using locking guide, two proximal shaft screws were inserted and locked the nail to the radius. Fluoroscopic imaging was taken and showing restoration of the height, tilt, and inclination of the radius. At this point, tourniquet was deflated, hemostasis achieved, wounds irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied. The patient then was extubated and transferred to the recovery room under stable condition. Postoperatively, the patient will see a therapist within five days.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe low back pain. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe low back pain. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: Anterior lumbar fusion, L4-L5, L5-S1, PEEK vertebral spacer, structural autograft from L5 vertebral body, BMP and anterior plate. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 50 mL. DRAINS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Dr. X made the approach and once we were at the L5-S1 disk space, we removed the disk and we placed a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer filled with a core of bone taken from the L5 vertebral body. This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug. At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1. OPERATION IN DETAIL: The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters. I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies. The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates. I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug. Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place. We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side. This was filled with bone and BMP as well. Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws. Following this, bleeding points were controlled and Dr. X proceeded with the closure of the abdomen. SUMMARY: This is a 51-year-old man who reports 15-year history of low back pain and intermittent bilateral leg pain and achiness. He has tried multiple conservative treatments including physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, etc. MRI scan shows a very degenerated disk at L5-S1, less so at L3-L4 and L4-L5. A discogram was positive with the lower 3 levels, but he has pain, which starts below the iliac crest and I feel that the L3-L4 disk is probably that symptomatic. An anterior lumbar interbody fusion was suggested. Procedure, risks, and complications were explained.",TRUE
" CC: Right shoulder pain. HX: This 46 y/o RHF presented with a 4 month history of right neck and shoulder stiffness and pain. The symptoms progressively worsened over the 4 month course. 2 weeks prior to presentation she began to develop numbness in the first and second fingers of her right hand and RUE pain. The later was described as a throbbing pain. She also experienced numbness in both lower extremities and pain in the coccygeal region. The pains worsened at night and impaired sleep. She denied any visual change, bowel or bladder difficulties and symptoms involving the LUE. She occasionally experienced an electric shock like sensation shooting down her spine when flexing her neck (Lhermitte's phenomena). She denied any history of neck/back/head trauma. She had been taking Naprosyn with little relief. PMH: 1) Catamenial Headaches. 2) Allergy to Macrodantin. SHX/FHX: Smokes 2ppd cigarettes. EXAM: Vital signs were unremarkable. CN: unremarkable. Motor: full strength throughout. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: No deficits on LT/PP/VIB/TEMP/PROP testing. Coord/Gait/Station: Unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 in BUE except 2+ at left biceps. 1+/1+BLE except an absent right ankle reflex. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rectal exam: normal tone. IMPRESSION: C-spine lesion.

" This is a middle-aged female with an enlarging mass of the left parotid region. FINDINGS: There is a well demarcated mass lesion of the deep lobe of the left parotid gland measuring approximately 2.4 X 3.9 X 3.0cm (AP X transverse X craniocaudal) in size. The lesion is well demarcated. There is a solid peripheral rim with a mean attenuation coefficient of 56.3. There is a central cystic appearing area with a mean attenuation coefficient of 28.1 HU, suggesting an area of central necrosis. There is the suggestion of mild peripheral rim enhancement. This large lesion within the deep lobe of the parotid gland abuts and effaces the facial nerve. Primary consideration is of a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), however, other solid mass lesions cannot be excluded, for which histologic evaluation would be necessary for definitive diagnosis. The right parotid gland is normal. There is mild enlargement of the left jugulodigastric node, measuring 1.1cm in size, with normal morphology (image #33/68). There is mild enlargement of the right jugulodigastric node, measuring 1.2cm in size, with normal morphology (image #38/68). There are demonstrated bilateral deep lateral cervical nodes at the midlevel, measuring 0.6cm on the right side and 0.9cm on the left side (image #29/68). There is a second midlevel deep lateral cervical node demonstrated on the left side (image #20/68), measuring 0.7cm in size. There are small bilateral low level nodes involving the deep lateral cervical nodal chain (image #15/68) measuring 0.5cm in size. There is no demonstrated nodal enlargement of the spinal accessory or pretracheal nodal chains. The right parotid gland is normal and there is no right parotid gland mass lesion. Normal bilateral submandibular glands. Normal parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal and perivertebral spaces. Normal carotid spaces. IMPRESSION: Large, well demarcated mass lesion of the deep lobe of the left parotid gland, with probable involvement of the left facial nerve. See above for size, morphology and pattern enhancement. Primary consideration is of a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), however, other solid mass lesions cannot be excluded, for which histologic evaluation is necessary for specificity.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus C5-C6. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus C5-C6. PROCEDURE: Anterior cervical discectomy fusion C5-C6 followed by instrumentation C5-C6 with titanium dynamic plating system, Aesculap. Operating microscope was used for both illumination and magnification. FIRST ASSISTANT: Nurse practitioner. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in supine position. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior discectomy and fusion. An incision was made midline to the anterior body of the sternocleidomastoid at C5-C6 level. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma muscle was divided exposing the carotid sheath, which was retracted laterally. Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. After placing the self-retaining retractors with the longus colli muscles having been dissected away from the vertebral bodies at C5 and C6 and confirming our position with intraoperative x-rays, we then proceeded with the discectomy. We then cleaned out the disc at C5-C6 after incising the annulus fibrosis. We cleaned out the disc with a combination of angled and straight pituitary rongeurs and curettes, and the next step was to clean out the disc space totally. With this having been done, we then turned our attention with the operating microscope to the osteophytes. We drilled off the vertebral osteophytes at C5-C6, as well as the uncovertebral osteophytes. This was removed along with the posterior longitudinal ligament. After we had done this, the dural sac was opposed very nicely and both C6 nerve roots were thoroughly decompressed. The next step after the decompression of the thecal sac and both C6 nerve roots was the fusion. We observed that there was a ____________ in the posterior longitudinal ligament. There was a free fragment disc, which had broken through the posterior longitudinal ligament just to the right of midline. The next step was to obtain the bone from the back bone, using cortical cancellous graft 10 mm in size after we had estimated the size. That was secured into place with distraction being applied on the vertebral bodies using vertebral body distractor. After we had tapped in the bone plug, we then removed the distraction and the bone plug was fitting nicely. We then use the Aesculap cervical titanium instrumentation with the 16-mm screws. After securing the C5-C6 disc with four screws and titanium plate, x-rays showed good alignment of the spine, good placement of the bone graft, and after x-rays showed excellent position of the bone graft and instrumentation, we then placed in a Jackson-Pratt drain in the prevertebral space brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and skin was closed with Steri-Strips. Blood loss during the operation was less than 10 mL. No complications of the surgery. Needle count, sponge count, and cottonoid count were correct.",TRUE
" PROCEDURE: Bilateral L5 dorsal ramus block and bilateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branch block. INDICATION: Sacroiliac joint pain. INFORMED CONSENT: The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient. The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks. The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible vascular entry of medications. I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids. The patient was informed both verbally and in writing. The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed. PROCEDURE: Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure. The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback. The X-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine. The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table, pillow under the chest, and head rotated contralateral to the side being treated. The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine. The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement. Fluoroscopic pillar view was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and sacroiliac joint and the planned needle approach. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine. With fluoroscopy, a 25-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and sacrum through the dorsal ramus of the L5 and the lateral and superior border of the posterior sacral foramen with the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3. Multiple fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement. Approximately 0.25 mL of nonionic contrast agent was injected showing no concurrent vascular dye pattern. Finally, the treatment solution, consisting of 0.5% of bupivacaine was injected to each area. All injected medications were preservative free. Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure. ADDITIONAL DETAILS: This was then repeated on the left side. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISCUSSION: Postprocedure vital signs and oximetry were stable. The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day. The patient was told to resume all medications. The patient was told to resume normal activities. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes or changes in bowel or bladder function.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Partial rotator cuff tear with impingement syndrome. 2. Degenerative osteoarthritis of acromioclavicular joint, left shoulder, rule out slap lesion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Partial rotator cuff tear with impingement syndrome. 2. Degenerative osteoarthritis of acromioclavicular joint, left shoulder. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopy with arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement. 2. Anterior acromioplasty. 3. Mumford procedure left shoulder. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operative Suite, Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital. This was done in a modified beach chair position with interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 38-year-old morbidly obese white male suffering increasing pain in his left shoulder for a number of months prior to surgical intervention. He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy. He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting. After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date. Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side. All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum. The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact. Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis. Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine upon the operative table. After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in. A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out. Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff. Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness. Attention was then turned to the subacromial region. The scope was directed subacromially. A portal was created laterally. Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle. Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver. #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this. It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200. Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure. Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured. An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation. Flaps were created. Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly. Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp. An excellent decompression was present. CA ligament had been previously resected. We then took the incision over the distal clavicle. The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw. The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges. Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl. Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same. A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally. Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing. 0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure. Pain buster catheter was hooked up. The patient's arm was placed in arm sling. He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative arthritis of the left knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative arthritis of the left knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total left knee replacement on 08/19/03. The patient also underwent a bilateral right total knee replacement in the same sitting and that will be dictated by Dr. X. TOURNIQUET TIME: 76 minutes. BLOOD LOSS: 150 cc. ANESTHESIA: General. IMPLANT USED FOR PROCEDURE: NexGen size F femur on the left with #8 size peg tibial tray, a #12 mm polyethylene insert and this a cruciate retaining component. The patella on the left was not resurfaced. GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Degenerative ware of three compartments of the trochlea, the medial, as well as the lateral femoral condyles as well was the plateau. The surface of the patella was with a minimal ware and minimal osteophytes and we decided not to resurface the patellar component. HISTORY: This is a 69-year-old male with complaints of bilateral knee pain for several years and increased intensity in the past several months where it has affected his activities of daily living. He attempted conservative treatment, which includes anti-inflammatory medications as well as cortisone and Synvisc. This has only provided him with temporary relief. It is for that reason, he is elected to undergo the above-named procedure. All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient, which include, but are not limited to infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain. He has agreed to undergo this procedure and a consent was obtained preoperatively. PROCEDURE: The patient was wheeled back to operating room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/19/03 and was placed supine on the operating room table. At this time, a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated. An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the left extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure. The tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg. At this time, a standard midline incision was made towards the total knee. We did discuss preoperatively for a possible unicompartmental knee replacement for this patient, but he did have radiographic evidence of chondrocalcinosis of the lateral meniscus. We did start off with a small midline skin incision in case we were going to do a unicompartmental. Once we exposed the medial parapatellar mini-arthrotomy and visualized the lateral femoral condyle, we decided that this patient would not be an optimal candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement. It is for this reason that we extended the incision and underwent with the total knee replacement. Once the full medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed with the subperiosteal dissection of the proximal tibia in order to evert the patella. Once the patella was everted, we then used a drill to cannulate the distal femoral canal in order to place the intramedullary guide. A Charnley awl was then used to remove all the intramedullary contents and they were removed from the knee. At this time, a femoral sizer was then placed with reference to the posterior condyles and we measured a size F. Once this was performed, three degrees of external rotation was then drilled into the condyle in alignment with the epicondyles of the femur. At this time, the intramedullary guide was then inserted and placed in three degrees of external rotation. Our anterior cutting guide was then placed and an anterior cut was performed with careful protection of the soft tissues. Next, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus. This was pinned to the distal femur and with careful protection of the collateral ligaments, a distal femoral cut was performed. At this time, the intramedullary guide was removed and a final cutting block was placed. This was placed in the center on the distal femur with 1 mm to 2 mm laterally translated for better patellar tracking. At this time, the block was pinned and screwed in place with spring pins with careful protection of the soft tissues. An oscillating saw was then used to resect the posterior and anterior cutting blocks with anterior and posterior chamfer as well as the notch cut. Peg holes were then drilled. The block was then removed and an osteotome was then used to remove all the bony cut pieces. At this time with a better exposure of the proximal tibia, we placed external tibial guide. This was placed with longitudinal axis of the tibia and carefully positioned in order to obtain an optimal cut for the proximal tibia. At this time with careful soft tissue retraction and protection, an oscillating saw was used to make a proximal tibial osteotomy. Prior to the osteotomy, the cut was checked with a depth gauge in order to assure appropriate bony resection. At this time, a _blunt Kocher and Bovie cautery were used to remove the proximal tibial cut, which had soft tissue attachments. Once this was removed, we then implanted our trial components of size F to the femur and a size 8 mm tibial tray with 12 mm plastic articulating surface. The knee was taken through range of motion and revealed excellent femorotibial articulation. The patella did tend to sublux somewhat laterally with extremes of flexion and it was for this reason, we performed a minimal small incision lateral retinacular release. Distal lateral patella was tracked more uniformly within the patellar groove of the prosthesis. At this time, an intraoperative x-ray was performed, which revealed excellent alignment with no varus angulation especially of the whole femur and tibial alignment and tibial cut. At this time, the prosthesis was removed. A McGill retractor was then reinserted and replaced peg tibial tray in order to peg the proximal tibia. Once the drill holes were performed, we then copiously irrigated the wound and then suctioned it dry to get ready and prepped for cementation of the drilled components. At this time, polymethyl methacrylate cement was then mixed. The cement was placed on the tibial surface as well as the underneath surface of the component. The component was then placed and impacted with excess cement removed. In a similar fashion, the femoral component was also placed. A 12 mm plastic tray was then placed and the leg held in full extension and compression in order to obtain adequate bony cement content. Once the cement was fully hardened, the knee was flexed and a small osteotome was used to remove any extruding cement from around the prosthesis of the bone. Once this was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound and the wound was then suctioned dry. The knee was again taken through range of motion with a 12 mm plastic as well as #14. The #14 appeared to be a bit too tight especially in extremes of flexion. We decided to go with a #12 mm polyethylene tray. At this time, this was placed to the tibial articulation and then left in place. This was rechecked with careful attention to detail with checking no soft tissue interpositioned between the polyethylene tray and the metal tray of the tibia. The knee was again taken through range of motion and revealed excellent tracking of the patella with good femur and tibial contact. A drain was placed and cut to length. At this time, the knee was irrigated and copiously suction dried. #1-0 Ethibond suture was then used to approximate the medial parapatellar arthrotomy in figure-of-eight fashion. A tight capsular closure was performed. This was reinforced with a #1-0 running Vicryl suture. At this time, the knee was again taken through range of motion to assure tight capsular closure. At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the superficial wound. #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the wound with figure-of-eight inverted suture. The skin was then approximated with staples. The leg was then cleansed. Sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, and Kerlix roll were then applied. At this time, the patient was extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition. Prognosis is good for this patient.",FALSE

INDICATION FOR SURGERY: The patient is a 19-year-old male, who sustained a gunshot wound to the left tibia with a distal tibial shaft fracture. The patient was admitted and splinted and had compartment checks. The risks of surgery were discussed in detail including, but not limited to infection, bleeding, injuries to nerves, or vital structures, nonunion or malunion, need for reoperation, compartment syndrome, and the risk of anesthesia. The patient understood these risks and wished to proceed. PREOP DIAGNOSIS: Left tibial shaft fracture status post gunshot wound (CPT code 27759). POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: Left tibial shaft fracture status post gunshot wound (CPT code 27759). ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. INTRAVENOUS FLUID: 900. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 100. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: Stable to PACU. PROCEDURE DETAIL: The patient was met in the preoperative holding area and operative site was marked. The patient was brought to the operating room and given preoperative antibiotics. Left leg was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline incision was made in the center of the knee and was carried down sharply to the retinacular tissue. The starting guidewire was used to localize the correct starting point, which is on the medial aspect of the lateral tibial eminence. This was advanced and confirmed on the AP and lateral fluoroscopic images. The opening reamer was then used and the ball-tip guidewire was passed. The reduction was obtained over a large radiolucent triangle. After passing the guidewire and achieving appropriate reduction, the flexible reamers were then sequentially passed, starting at 9 mm up to 11.5 mm reamer. At this point, a 10 x 390 mm was passed without difficulty. The guide was used to the proximal locking screw and the appropriate circle technique was used to the distal locking screws. The final images were taken with fluoroscopy and a 15-mm end-cap was placed. The wounds were then irrigated and closed with 2-0 Vicryl followed by staples to the distal screws and 0 Vicryl followed 2-0 Vicryl and staples to the proximal incision.

" PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed in the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic. Ancef 1 g was given for infectious prophylaxis. Once the patient was under general anesthesia, the knee was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Once the knee was fully prepped and draped, then we made 2 standard portals medial and lateral. Through the lateral portal, the camera was placed. Through the medial portal, tools were placed. We proceeded to examine scarring of the patellofemoral joint. Then we probed the patellofemoral joint. A chondroplasty was performed using a shaver. Then we moved down to the lateral gutter. Some loose bodies were found using a shaver and dissection. We moved down the medial gutter. No plica was found. We moved into the medial joint; we found that the medial meniscus was intact. We moved to the lateral joint and found that the lateral meniscus was intact. Pictures were taken. We drained the knee and washed out the knee with copious amounts of sterile saline solution.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right wrist pain with an x-ray showing a scapholunate arthritic collapse pattern arthritis with osteophytic spurring of the radial styloid and a volar radial wrist mass suspected of being a volar radial ganglion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right wrist pain with an x-ray showing a scapholunate arthritic collapse pattern arthritis with osteophytic spurring of the radial styloid and a volar radial wrist mass suspected of being a volar radial ganglion; finding of volar radial wrist mass of bulging inflammatory tenosynovitis from the volar radial wrist joint rather than a true ganglion cyst; synovitis was debrided and removed. PROCEDURE: Excision of volar radial wrist mass (inflammatory synovitis) and radial styloidectomy, right wrist. ANESTHESIA: Axillary block plus IV sedation. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Zero. SPECIMENS 1. Inflammatory synovitis from the volar radial wrist area. 2. Inflammatory synovitis from the dorsal wrist area. DRAINS: None. PROCEDURE DETAIL: Patient brought to the operating room. After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff. Routine prep and drape was employed. Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively. Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet. Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure. Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder. A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made. Skin was sharply incised. Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue. Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery. Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches. Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery. Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection. This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule. This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window. After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture. Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene. Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision. An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made. Skin was sharply incised. Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue. Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve. Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum. This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment. EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury. The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone. Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified. This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen. Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis. Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer. Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur. Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained. Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided. Remnants of the scapholunate interosseous which was completely deteriorated were debrided. The joint capsule was closed anatomically with 4-0 PDS and extensor retinaculum was closed with 4-0 PDS. Subcutaneous tissues closed with 4-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene. Steri-Strips were applied to wound edge closure; 10 cc of 0.5% plain Marcaine was infiltrated into the areas of the surgical incisions and radial styloidectomy for postoperative analgesia.

" CHIEF COMPLAINT: Back pain and right leg pain. The patient has a three-year history of small cell lung cancer with metastases. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is on my schedule today to explore treatment of the above complaints. She has a two-year history of small cell lung cancer, which she says has spread to metastasis in both femurs, her lower lumbar spine, and her pelvis. She states she has had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments and told me that she has lost count. She says she has just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief. She states she continues to have significant pain symptoms. Most of her pain seems to be in her low back on the right side, radiating down the back of her right leg to her knee. She has also some numbness in the bottom of her left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times. She complains of some diffuse, mid back pain. She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching in nature. She rates her back pain as 10, her right leg pain as 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. She states that it seems to be worse while sitting in the car with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking. She is on significant doses of narcotics. She has had multiple CT scans looking for metastasis. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for cancer as above. She also has a depression. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for a chest port placement. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Consist of Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet. She does not know of what strength up to eight daily. She also is on warfarin 1 mg daily, which she states is just to keep her chest port patent. She is on Neurontin 300 mg three times daily. HABITS: She smokes one pack a day for last 30 years. She drinks beer approximately twice daily. She denies use of recreational drugs. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married. She lives with her spouse. FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for two brothers and father who have cancer. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Significant mainly for her pain complaints. For other review of systems the patient seems stable. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: Reveals a pleasant somewhat emaciated Caucasian female. Vital Signs: Height is 5 feet 2 inches. Weight is 130 pounds. She is afebrile. HEENT: Benign. Neck: Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's. Chest: Clear to auscultation. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen: Soft, regular bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal: Examination shows functional range of joint movements. No focal muscle weakness. She is deconditioned. Neurologic: She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect. The patient has normal tone and coordination. Reflexes are 2+ in both knees and absent at both ankles. Sensations are decreased distally in the left foot, otherwise intact to pinprick. Spine: Examination of her lumbar spine shows normal lumbar lordosis with fairly functional range of movement. The patient had significant tenderness at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints, which seems to reproduce a lot of her low back and right leg complaints. FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it. INVESTIGATION: She has had again multiple scans including a whole body bone scan, which showed abnormal uptake involving the femurs bilaterally. She has had increased uptake in the sacroiliac joint regions bilaterally. CT of the chest showed no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease. CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of metastatic disease. MRI of the lower hip joints showed heterogenous bone marrow signal in both proximal femurs. CT of the pelvis showed a trabecular pattern with healed metastases. CT of the orbits showed small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on the right, otherwise normal CT scan. MR of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities and no significant interval changes. IMPRESSION: 1. Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs. 2. Symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right. 3. Chronic pain syndrome. RECOMMENDATIONS: Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology. Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right. Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today. I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed. She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this. We have asked for stat protime today. She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications. She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms. Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed. I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday. I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead. She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan. I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation. Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. G's findings. Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Patellar tendon retinaculum ruptures, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Patellar tendon retinaculum ruptures, right knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Patellar tendon and medial and lateral retinaculum repair, right knee. SPECIFICATIONS: Intraoperative procedure done at Inpatient Operative Suite, room #2 of ABCD Hospital. This was done under subarachnoid block anesthetic in supine position. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American male who suffered acute rupture of his patellar tendon diagnosed both by exam as well as x-ray the evening before surgical intervention. He did this while playing basketball. He had a massive deficit at the inferior pole of his patella on exam. Once opened, he had complete rupture of this patellar tendon as well as a complete rupture of his medial lateral retinaculum. Minimal cartilaginous pieces were at the patellar tendon. He had grade II changes to his femoral sulcus as well as grade I-II changes to the undersurface of the patella. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine on the operative table receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department. A thigh high tourniquet was placed. He is prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Limb was elevated, exsanguinated and tourniquet placed at 325 mmHg for approximately 30 to 40 minutes. Straight incision is carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue anteriorly. Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation. Patellar tendon was isolated along with the patella itself. A 6 mm Dacron tape x2 was placed with a modified Kessler tendon stitch with a single limb both medially and laterally and a central limb with subsequent shared tape. The inferior pole was freshened up. Drill bit was utilized to make holes x3 longitudinally across the patella and the limbs strutted up through the patella with a suture passer. This was tied over the bony bridge superiorly. There was excellent reduction of the tendon to the patella. Interrupted running #1-Vicryl suture was utilized for over silk. A running #2-0 Vicryl for synovial closure medial and laterally as well as #1-Vicryl medial and lateral retinaculum. There was excellent repair. Copious irrigation was carried out.

" PROCEDURE: Carpal tunnel release with transverse carpal ligament reconstruction. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A longitudinal incision was made in line with the fourth ray, from Kaplan's cardinal line proximally to 1 cm distal to the volar wrist crease. The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis. The subcutaneous fat was dissected radially for 2-3 mm, and the superficial aponeurosis cut on this side to leave a longer ulnar leaf. The ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis was dissected ulnarly, and the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat. The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat. The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with a scissor. After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the radial leaf of the cut transverse carpal ligament was repaired to the ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis with 4-0 Vicryl. Care was taken to avoid entrapping the motor branch of the median nerve in the suture. A hemostat was placed under the repair to ensure that the median nerve was not compressed. The skin was repaired with 5-0 nylon interrupted stitches. Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound, which was then dressed and splinted. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome. PROCEDURE: Endoscopic release of left transverse carpal ligament. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia provided by surgeon. TOURNIQUET TIME: 12 minutes. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: With the patient under adequate monitored anesthesia, the left upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The arm was exsanguinated. The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mmHg. Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray. A transverse incision was made in the palm between FCR and FCU, one finger breadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin. Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery. A distal based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned. Care was taken to protect the underlying contents. A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface. Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the Hood of Hamate. The Agee Inside Job was then inserted into the proximal incision. The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal. Using palmar pressure, transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end. The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window. The blade was then elevated, and the Agee Inside Job was withdrawn, dividing transverse carpal ligament under direct vision. After complete division of transverse carpal ligament, the Agee Inside Job was reinserted. Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified and complete release was accomplished. One cc of Celestone was then introduced into the carpal tunnel and irrigated free. The wound was then closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Steri-strips were applied and a sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-strips. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.",FALSE

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Metatarsus primus varus with bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Hallux abductovalgus with angulation deformity, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Metatarsus primus varus with bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Hallux abductovalgus with angulation deformity, right foot. PROCEDURES: 1. Distal metaphyseal osteotomy and bunionectomy with internal screw fixation, right foot. 2. Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx, right foot. ANESTHESIA: Local infiltrate with IV sedation. INDICATION FOR SURGERY: The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems. The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment. The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options. The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail. The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain. All questions were thoroughly answered. The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities. The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort. DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position. No tourniquet was utilized. IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site. The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Balanced anesthesia was obtained. PROCEDURE #1: Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot. A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx. Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery. Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized. A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision. The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface. Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head. The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound. Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition. The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition. An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration. Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove. The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp. Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment. The access guide was noted to be in good position. A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed. The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal. The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head. The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal. Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment. It was then fixated with 1 screw. A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction. The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position. Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory. Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site. Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally. All rough edges were rasped smooth. Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux. A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated. PROCEDURE #2: Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux. The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint. All vital structures were identified and retracted. Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface. The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux. Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected. The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position. Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site. The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved. The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation. The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips. Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia. A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression. The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time. A walker boot was dispensed and applied. The patient should wear it when walking or standing. The next office visit will be in 4 days. The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions. The patient was discharged home with vital signs stable in no acute distress.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed displaced probable pathological fracture, basicervical femoral neck, left hip. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed displaced probable pathological fracture, basicervical femoral neck, left hip. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Left hip cemented hemiarthroplasty. 2. Biopsy of the tissue from the fracture site and resected femoral head sent to the pathology for further assessment. IMPLANTS USED: 1. DePuy Ultima calcar stem, size 3 x 45. 2. Bipolar head 28 x 43. 3. Head with +0 neck length. 4. Distal centralizer and cement restrictor. 5. SmartSet antibiotic cement x2. ANESTHESIA: General. NEEDLE AND SPONGE COUNT: Correct. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 300 mL. SPECIMEN: Resected femoral head and tissue from the fracture site as well as the marrow from the canal. FINDINGS: On exposure, the fracture was noted to be basicervical pattern with no presence of calcar about the lesser trochanter. The lesser trochanter was intact. The fracture site was noted to show abnormal pathological tissue with grayish discoloration. The quality of the bone was also pathologically abnormal with soft trabecular bone. The abnormal pathological tissues were sent along with the femoral head to pathology for assessment. Articular cartilage of the acetabulum was intact and well preserved. INDICATION: The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of malignant melanoma, who apparently had severe pain in her left lower extremity and was noted to have a basicervical femoral neck fracture. She denied any history of fall or trauma. The presentation was consistent with pathological fracture pending tissue assessment. Indication, risks, and benefits were discussed. Treatment options were reviewed. No guarantees have been made or implied. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, she was positioned on a pegboard with the left side up. The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion. Time-out procedure was called. Antibiotics were infused. A standard posterolateral approach was made. Subcutaneous dissection was performed and the dissection was carried down to expose the fascia of the gluteus maximus. This was then incised along the line of the incision. Hemostasis was achieved. Charnley retractor was positioned. The trochanter was intact. The gluteus medius was well protected with retractor. The piriformis and minimus junction was identified. The minimus was also reflected along with the medius. Using Bovie and knife, the piriformis and external rotators were detached from its trochanteric insertion. Similarly, L-shaped capsulotomy was performed. A #5 Ethibond was utilized to tag the piriformis and the capsule for late repair. Fracture site was exposed. The femoral neck fracture was noted to be very low-lying basicervical type. Femoral head was retrieved without any difficulty with the help of a corkscrew. The head size was measured to be 43 mm. Bony fragments were removed. The acetabular socket was thoroughly irrigated. A 43-mm bipolar trial head was inserted and this was noted to give a satisfactory fit with good stability. The specimens submitted to pathology included the resected femoral head and the tissue at the fracture site, which was abnormal with grayish discoloration. This was sent to the pathology. The fracture was noted to be basicervical and preoperatively, decision was made to consider cemented calcar stem. An L-shaped osteotomy was performed in order to accept the calcar prosthesis. The basicervical fracture was noted to be just at the level of superior border of the lesser trochanter. There was no calcar superior to the lesser trochanter. The L-shaped osteotomy was performed to refine the bony edges and accept the calcar prosthesis. Hemostasis was achieved. Now, the medullary canal was entered with a canal finder. The fracture site was well exposed. Satisfactory lateralization was performed. Attention was for the reaming process. Using a size 1 reamer, the medullary canal was entered and reamed up to size 3, which gave us a satisfactory fit into the canal. At this point, a trial prosthesis size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was inserted. Appropriate anteversion was positioned. The anteversion was marked with a Bovie to identify subsequent anteversion during implantation. The bony edges were trimmed. The calcar implant with 45 mm neck length was fit in the host femur very well. There was no evidence of any subsidence. At this point, trial reduction was performed using a bipolar trial head with 0 neck length. The relationship between the central femoral head and the greater trochanter was satisfactory. The hip was well reduced without any difficulty. The stability and range of motion in extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation was satisfactory. The shuck was less than 1 mm. Leg length was satisfactory in reference to the contralateral leg. Stability was satisfactory at 90 degrees of flexion and hip at 75-80 degrees of internal rotation. Similarly, keeping the leg completely adducted, I was able to internally rotate the hip to 45 degrees. After verifying the stability and range of motion in all direction, trial components were removed. The canal was thoroughly irrigated and dry sponge was inserted and canal was dried completely. At this point, 2 batches of SmartSet cement with antibiotics were mixed. The definitive Ultima calcar stem size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was selected. Centralizer was positioned. The cement restrictor was inserted. Retrograde cementing technique was applied once the canal was dried. Using cement gun, retrograde cementing was performed. The stem was then inserted into cemented canal with appropriate anteversion, which was maintained until the cement was set hard and cured. The excess cement was removed with the help of a curette and Freer elevator. All the cement debris was removed. Attention was now placed for the insertion of the trial femoral head. Once again, 0 neck length trial bipolar head was inserted over the trunnion. It was reduced and range of motion and stability was satisfactory. I also attempted with a -3 trial head, but the 0 gave us a satisfactory stability, range of motion, as well as the length and the shuck was also minimal. The hip was raised to 90 degrees of flexion and 95 degrees of internal rotation. There was no evidence of any impingement on extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation. I also tested the hip at 90 degrees of flexion with 10 degrees adduction and internal rotation and further progressive flexion of the hip beyond 90 degrees, which was noted to be very stable. At this point, a definitive component using +0 neck length and bipolar 43 head were placed over the trunnion and the hip was reduced. Range of motion and stability was as above. Now, the attention was placed for the repair of the capsule and the external rotators and the piriformis. This was repaired to the trochanteric insertion using #5 Ethibond and suture plaster. Satisfactory reinforcement was achieved with the #5 Ethibond. The wound was thoroughly irrigated. Hemostasis was achieved. The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure using 2-0 Vicryl. The wound was thoroughly washed and a local injection with mixture of morphine and Toradol was infiltrated including the capsule and the pericapsular structures. Skin was approximated with staples. Sterile dressings were placed. Abduction pillow was positioned and the patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications noted.",FALSE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion, and potentially unstable cervical spine. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Application of PMT large halo crown and vest. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None. ANESTHESIA: Local, conscious sedation with Morphine and Versed. COMPLICATIONS: None. Post-fixation x-rays, nonalignment, no new changes. Post-fixation neurologic examination normal. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 41-year-old female who presented to me with severe cervical spondylosis and myelopathy. She was referred to me by Dr. X. The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate. Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days. She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities. No airway issues. It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller. She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest. The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1. I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure. I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine. A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic. Excellent fixation achieved. It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae. I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck. The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected. Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline. All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened. During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain. Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout. X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes. The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on. The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days. Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery. She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course. The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family.",FALSE

INDICATION: This is a gentleman with right-sided lumbosacral radiculopathy, MRI disclosed and lateral recess stenosis at the L4-5, L5-S1 foraminal narrowing in L4 and L5 roots. The patient was felt to be a candidate for decompression stabilization pulling distraction between the screws to relieve radicular pain. The patient understood major risks and complications such as death and paralysis seemingly rare, main concern is a 10 to 15% of failure rate to respond to surgery for which further surgery may or may not be indicated, small risk of wound infection, spinal fluid leak. The patient is understanding and agreed to proceed and signed the consent. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, peripheral venous lines were placed. General anesthesia was induced. The patient was intubated. Foley catheter was in place. The patient laid prone onto the OSI table using 6-post, pressure points were carefully padded; the back was shaved, sterilely prepped and draped. A previous incision was infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel. The posterior spine on the right side was exposed in routine fashion along with transverse processes in L4-L5 in the sacral ala. Laminotomies were then performed at L4-L5 and L5-S1 in a similar fashion using Midas Rex drill with AM8 bit, inferior portion of lamina below and superior portion of lamina above, and the medial facet was drilled down to the thin shelf of bone. The thin shelf of bone along the ligamentum flavum moved in a piecemeal fashion with 2 and 3 mm Kerrison, bone was harvested throughout to be used for bone grafting. The L5 and S1 roots were completely unroofed in the lateral recess working lateral to the markedly hypertrophied facet joints. Transpedicular approaches were carried out for both L4 and L5 roots working lateral to medial and medial to lateral with foraminotomies, L4-L5 roots were extensively decompressed. Pars interarticularis were maintained. Using angled 2-mm Kerrisons hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, the superior facet of S1 and L5 was resected increasing the dimensions for the foramen passed lateral to medial and medial to lateral without further compromise. Pedicle screws were placed L4-L5 and S1 on the right side. Initial hole began with Midas Rex drill, deepened with a gear shift and with 4.5 mm tap, palpating with pedicle probe. It showed no penetration outside the pedicle vertebral body. At L4-L5 5.5 x 45 mm screws were placed and at S1 5.5 x 40 mm screw was placed. Good bone purchase was obtained. Gelfoam was placed over the roots laterally, corticated transverse processes lateral facet joints were prepared, small infuse sponge was placed posterolaterally on the right side, then the local bone graft from L4 to S1. Traction was applied between the L4-L5, L5-S1 screws locking notes were tightened out, heads were rotated fractured off about 2-3 mm traction were applied at each side, further opening the foramen for the exiting roots.

" Chief Complaint: Back and hip pain. History of Present Illness: The patient is a 73 year old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease secondary to reflux nephropathy / restriction of bladder neck requiring hemodialysis and eventual cadaveric renal transplant now on chronic immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease with non-healing ulcer of right great toe, and peripheral neuropathy who initially presented to his primary care physician in May 2001 with complaints of low back pain and bilateral hip pain. The pain was described as a constant pain in the middle to lower back and hips. The pain was exacerbated by climbing stairs and in the morning after sleeping. He reported occasional radiation of pain from back into buttocks (greatest on the right side). He has history of chronic feet and leg numbness and paraesthesias related to his neuropathy, but he denied any recent changes in these symptoms in relation to the back pain. He denied any history of trauma. He was treated symptomatically with Acetaminophen with only some relief. He continued to complain intermittently of pain in his back and hips, and occasionally even in his elbows during the next 8 months. In January 2002, plain pelvic films showed no fracture or dislocation of the hips. Elbow films also showed no acute injury, but there were some erosions along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time. His pain continued and progressively worsened, becoming unresponsive to medical therapy including narcotics In May 2002, as part of a vascular work-up for the patient�s non-healing right toe, an MRA showed extensive vascular disease in the vessels of both legs below the knees and evidence of bilateral trochanteric bursitis.

Degenerative disk disease at L4-5 with diffuse annular bulging and a broad based right lateral foraminal and extra-foraminal far lateral herniation which results in significant encroachment on the right lateral recess and neural foramen, and this deserves clinical correlation for right L4 and L5 radiculopathy. Degenerative facet joint changes and ligamentum flavum thickening are noted bilaterally at this level, but the central canal is adequate. 3. Spondylosis with annular bulging and facet joint degenerative disease at L5-S1, L3-L4, and L1-L2 to a mild degree without significant stenosis. 4. Note is made of probable cyst of the upper pole of the right kidney which measures 1.8cm in diameter. There is decrease in size of the right kidney which may be due to chronic renal disease. 1/02 Left Elbow Films (2 views): Rather extensive vascular calcification in the soft tissues. There is no evidence of an acute injury. There is, however, what appears to be some erosion along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. 1/02 Pelvis films: There is no fracture or dislocation of the hip identified. Extensive vascular calcification noted. 5/02 MRA Lower Extremity with and without contrast: 1. Minimal atherosclerotic narrowing of the bilateral superficial femoral arteries. Severe atherosclerotic disease of bilateral popliteal, anterior tibial, peroneal, and posterior tibial arteries (right greater than left). 2. Abnormal enhancing lesion in the left proximal femur, the left iliac bone, and the right iliac bone. There may be a similar lesion in the right tibia. 3. Abnormal enhancement in the trochanteric bursa of both femurs consistent with bursitis. 4. The vertebral bodies demonstrate abnormal enhancement adjacent to the end-plates likely due to degenerative disk disease. There are questionable abnormal enhancing lesions in the vertebral bodies. 6/02 Chest X-ray There are no compression fractures identified. The lungs are adequately expanded. Two densities in right hemithorax that appear to represent healing rib fractures. The one involving the right 7th rib posteriorly could be a pathologic fracture.

" TITLE OF OPERATION: Revision laminectomy L5-S1, discectomy L5-S1, right medial facetectomy, preparation of disk space and arthrodesis with interbody graft with BMP. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: Please refer to medical record, but in short, the patient is a 43-year-old male known to me, status post previous lumbar surgery for herniated disk with severe recurrence of axial back pain, failed conservative therapy. Risks and benefits of surgery were explained in detail including risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, heart attack, paralysis, need for further surgery, hardware failure, persistent symptoms, and death. This list was inclusive, but not exclusive. An informed consent was obtained after all patient's questions were answered. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe lumbar spondylosis L5-S1, collapsed disk space, hypermobility, and herniated disk posteriorly. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe lumbar spondylosis L5-S1, collapsed disk space, hypermobility, and herniated disk posteriorly. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia and endotracheal tube intubation. DISPOSITION: The patient to PACU with stable vital signs. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room. After adequate general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation was obtained, the patient was placed prone on the Jackson table. Lumbar spine was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. An incision was carried out from L4 to S1. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar and Bovie cauterization. A Weitlaner was placed in the wound and a subperiosteal dissection was carried out identifying the lamina of L4, L5, and sacrum. At this time, laminectomy was carried out of L5-S1. Thecal sac was retracted rightward and the foramen was opened and unilateral medial facetectomy was carried out in the disk space. At this time, the disk was entered with a #15 blade and bipolar. The disk was entered with straight up and down-biting pituitaries, curettes, and the high speed drill and we were able to takedown calcified herniated disk. We were able to reestablish the disk space, it was very difficult, required meticulous dissection and then drilling with a diamond bur in the disk space underneath the spinal canal, very carefully holding the spinal canal out of harm's way as well as the exiting nerve root. Once this was done, we used rasps to remove more disk material anteriorly and under the midline to the left side and then we put in interbody graft of BMP 8 mm graft from Medtronic. At this time, Dr. X will dictate the posterolateral fusion, pedicle screw fixation to L4 to S1 with compression and will dictate the closure of the wound. There were no complications.",TRUE
" PREOP DIAGNOSES: 1. Left pilon fracture. 2. Left great toe proximal phalanx fracture. POSTOP DIAGNOSES: 1. Left pilon fracture. 2. Left great toe proximal phalanx fracture. OPERATION PERFORMED: 1. External fixation of left pilon fracture. 2. Closed reduction of left great toe, T1 fracture. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. Needle, instrument, and sponge counts were done and correct. DRAINS AND TUBES: None. SPECIMENS: None. INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 58-year-old female who was involved in an auto versus a tree accident on 6/15/2009. The patient suffered a fracture of a distal tibia and fibula as well as her great toe on the left side at that time. The patient was evaluated by the emergency room and did undergo further evaluation due to loss of consciousness. She underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the Medicine Service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention. Due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation. The patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome. Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband. All questions were answered, and consent was obtained. The risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery. FINDINGS: 1. There was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture. Following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length. 2. The base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement. As the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed. 3. Her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed. OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area. The left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient. She was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team. She received Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis. A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics. When all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. At this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site. A single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 Schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able. When this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture. Attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive. X-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture. At this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends. The stab wounds for the Schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with Betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition. Please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case. PLAN: The patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication. She will maintain her buddy taping in regards to her great toe fracture.",TRUE

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left carpal tunnel release. FINDINGS: Showed severe compression of the median nerve on the left at the wrist. SPECIMENS: None. FLUIDS: 500 mL of crystalloids. URINE OUTPUT: No Foley catheter. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General through a laryngeal mask. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None. CONDITION: Resuscitated with stable vital signs. INDICATION FOR THE OPERATION: This is a case of a very pleasant 65-year-old forensic pathologist who I previously had performed initially a discectomy and removal of infection at 6-7, followed by anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C5-6 and C6-7 with spinal instrumentation. At the time of initial consultation, the patient was also found to have bilateral carpal tunnel and for which we are addressing the left side now. Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him for most of the risk would be that of infection because of the patient's diabetes and a previous history of infection in the form of pneumonia. There is also the possibility of bleeding as well as the possibility of injury to the median nerve on dissection. He understood this risk and agreed to have the procedure performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress. After smooth induction of anesthesia and placement of a laryngeal mask, he remained supine on the operating table. The left upper extremity was then prepped with Betadine soap and antiseptic solution. After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made following inflation of blood pressure cuff to 250 mmHg. Clamp time approximately 30 minutes. An incision was then made right in the mid palm area between the thenar and hypothenar eminence. Meticulous hemostasis of any bleeders were done. The fat was identified. The palmar aponeurosis was identified and cut and this was traced down to the wrist. There was severe compression of the median nerve. Additional removal of the aponeurosis was performed to allow for further decompression. After this was all completed, the area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin solution and closed as a single layer using Prolene 4-0 as interrupted vertical mattress stitches. Dressing was applied. The patient was brought to the recovery.",TRUE

INDICATIONS: The patient is a 14-year-old right-hand dominant male who cut the back of his left little finger and had a small cut to his extensor tendon. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative room, laid supine, administered intervenous sedation with Bier block and prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The old laceration was opened and the extensor tendon was identified and there was a small longitudinal laceration in the tendon, which is essentially in line with the tendon fibers. This was just proximal to the PIP joint and on complete flexion of the PIP joint, I did separate just a little bit that was not thought to be significantly dynamically unstable. It was sutured with a single 4-0 Prolene interrupted figure-of-eight suture and on dynamic motion it did not separate at all. The wound was irrigated and closed with 5-0 nylon interrupted sutures.

" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hallux abductovalgus deformity. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hallux abductovalgus deformity. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Right McBride bunionectomy. 2. Right basilar wedge osteotomy with OrthoPro screw fixation. ANESTHESIA: Local with IV sedation. HEMOSTASIS: With pneumatic ankle cuff. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position. The right foot was prepared and draped in usual sterile manner. Anesthesia was achieved utilizing a 50:50 mixture of 2% lidocaine plain with 0.5 Marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint. Hemostasis was achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle Tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmHg. At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length was made. The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary. The incision was then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary. The capsular incision following the same outline as the skin incision was made and carried down to the underlying bony structure. The capsule was then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection. Using a microsagittal saw, the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area was inspected for any remaining bony prominences following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp. At this time, attention was directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection. Dissection was carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon, which was isolated and freed from its phalangeal, sesamoidal, and metatarsal attachments. The tendon was noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time was tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 0.5 cm to help prevent any re-fibrous attachment. At this time, the lateral release was stressed and was found to be complete. The extensor hallucis brevis tendon was then isolated using blunt dissection and was tenotomized as well taking out approximately 0.5-cm resection. The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected for any bony prominences remaining and it was noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head was going to be very prominent in nature and at this time was removed using a microsagittal saw. The area was again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormalities and/or prominences and none were noted. At this time, attention was directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision was made approximately 4 cm in length. The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary. The incision was then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structures were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structures to avoid any disruption. At this time, there was a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint. At this time, 0.5 cm was measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw, a wedge osteotomy was taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial, taking care to keep the medial cortex intact as a hinge. The osteotomy site was feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an OrthoPro screw 3.0 x 22 mm. The screw was placed following proper technique. The osteotomy site was found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing. A very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site was found and this was filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that was left over from the wedge osteotomy. The packing of the cancellous bone was held in place with bone wax. The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed. At this time, a deep closure was achieved utilizing #2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular closure was achieved using #4-0 Vicryl suture, and skin repair was achieved at both surgical sites with #5-0 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion. The hallux was found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the McBride bunionectomy and the metatarsal was found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site. At this time, the surgical site was postoperatively injected with 0.5 Marcaine plain as well as dexamethasone 4 mg primarily. The surgical sites were then dressed with sterile Xeroform, sterile 4x4s, cascading, and Kling with a final protective layer of fiberglass in a nonweightbearing cast fashion. The tourniquet was dropped and color and temperature of all digits returned to normal. The patient tolerated the anesthesia and the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition. The patient has been given written and verbal postoperative instructions and has been instructed to call if she has any questions, problems, or concerns at any time with the numbers provided. The patient has also been warned a number of times the importance of elevation and no weightbearing on the surgical foot.",FALSE

They have previously seen another orthopedist who recommended observation at this time. She is here for a second opinion in regards to kyphosis. The patient denies any pain in her back or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in her upper or lower extremities. No problems with her bowels or bladder. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Bilateral pinning of her ears. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is currently an eighth grader at Middle School and is interested in basketball. She lives with both of her parents and has a 9-year-old brother. She had menarche beginning in September. FAMILY HISTORY: Of kyphosis in great grandmother and second cousin. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She is in her usual state of health and is negative except otherwise as mentioned in the history of present illness. MEDICATIONS: She is currently on Zyrtec, Flonase, and Ceftin for an ear infection. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. FINDINGS: On physical exam, she is alert, oriented, and in no acute distress standing 63 inches tall. In regards to her back, her skin is intact with no rashes, lesions, and/or no dimpling or hair spots. No cafe au lait spots. She is not tender to palpation from her occiput to her sacrum. There is no evidence of paraspinal muscle spasm. On forward bending, there is a mild kyphosis. She is not able to touch her toes indicating her hamstring tightness. She has a full 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups. Her lower extremities including iliopsoas, quadriceps, gastroc-soleus, tibialis anterior, and extensor hallucis longus. Her sensation intact to light touch in L1 through L2 dermatomal distributions. She has symmetric limb lengths as well bilaterally from both the coronal and sagittal planes. X-rays today included PA and lateral sclerosis series. She has approximately 46 degree kyphosis. ASSESSMENT: Kyphosis. PLANS: The patient's kyphosis is quite mild. While this is likely in the upper limits of normal or just it is normal for an adolescent and still within normal range as would be expected return at home. At this time, three options were discussed with the parents including observation, physical therapy, and bracing. At this juncture, given that she has continued to grow, they are Risser 0. She may benefit from continued observation with physical therapy, bracing would be a more aggressive option certainly that thing would be lost with following at this time. As such, she was given a prescription for physical therapy for extension based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, postural training with no forward bending. We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat radiographs at that time including PA and lateral standing of scoliosis series. Should she show evidence of continued progression of her kyphotic deformity, discussions of bracing would be held at time. We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat evaluation.",FALSE
" OPERATION PERFORMED: Ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty of right wrist. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. Attention was turned to the base of the thumb where a longitudinal incision was made over the anatomic snuffbox and extended out onto the carpometacarpal joint. Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field. Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium. An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint. Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon. The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid. The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit. Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision. The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures. Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound. The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal. A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration. The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position. The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor. Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect. The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures. Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire. The pin was cut at the level of the skin. All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Sterile dressings were then applied. The tourniquet was deflated.

" PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left cervical radiculopathy at C5, C6 OPERATION: Left C5-6 hemilaminotomy and foraminotomy with medial facetectomy for microscopic decompression of nerve root. After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was taken to the OR. After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted. At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position. The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine. A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated. After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken. This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level. Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified. After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken. This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time. At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina. The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe. This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur. However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone. Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area. After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur. At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed. However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade. Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery. After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin. Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches. The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon. The skin was reapproximated using a running 000 nylon. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient was then extubated in the OR and transferred to the Recovery room in stable condition. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: minimal.",TRUE
" PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: T12 compression fracture with cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: T12 compression fracture with cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression. OPERATION PERFORMED: Decompressive laminectomy at T12 with bilateral facetectomies, decompression of T11 and T12 nerve roots bilaterally with posterolateral fusion supplemented with allograft bone chips and pedicle screws and rods with crosslink Synthes Click'X System using 6.5 mm diameter x 40 mm length T11 screws and L1 screws, 7 mm diameter x 45 mm length. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 400 mL, replaced 2 units of packed cells. Preoperative hemoglobin was less than 10. DRAINS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient prepped and draped in a routine fashion in the prone position on laminae support, an x-ray was taken and demonstrated a needle at the T12-L1 interspace. An incision was made over the posterior spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2. A Weitlaner retractor was placed and cutting Bovie current was used to incise the fascia overlying the dorsal spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2. An additional muscular ligamentous attachment was dissected free bilaterally with cutting Bovie current osteotome and Cobb elevator. The cerebellar retractors were placed in the wound and obvious deformation of the lamina particularly on the left side at T12 was apparent. Initially, on the patient's left side, pedicle screws were placed in T11 and L1. The inferior articular facet was removed at T11 and an awl placed at the proximal location of the pedicle. Placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy. The awl was in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control, the pedicle was probed to the mid portion of the body of T11. A 40-mm Click'X screw, 6.5 mm diameter with rod holder was then threaded into the T11 vertebral body. Attention was next turned to the L1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse processes with the superior articular facet and intra-articular process was located using an AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment to the Midas Rex instrumentation. The area was decorticated, an awl was placed, and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in L1. Using a pedicle probe, the pedicle was then probed to the mid body of L1 and a 7-mm diameter 45-mm in length Click'X Synthes screw with rod holder was placed in the L1 vertebral body. At this point, an elongated rod was placed on the left side for purposes of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the MRI findings of significant compression on the patient's ventral canal on the right side. Attention was next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above was carried out with operating room microscope and at this point, the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at T12 was noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis. The anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the T12 was incised with cutting Bovie current and the posterior spinous process at T12 removed with a Leksell rongeur. It was necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at T11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fractures at T12. At this point, a laminectomy was performed using 45-degree Kerrison rongeur, both 2 mm and 4 mm, and Leksell rongeur. There was an epidural hematoma encountered to the midline and left side at the mid portion of the T12 laminectomy and this was extending superiorly to the T11-T12 interlaminar space. Additionally, there was marked instability of the facets bilaterally at T12 and L1. These facets were removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur and Leksell rongeur. Bony compression both superiorly and laterally from fractured bony elements was removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur until the thecal sac was completely decompressed. The exiting nerve roots at T11 and T12 were visualized and followed with Frazier dissectors, and these nerve roots were noted to be completely free. Hemostasis was controlled with bipolar coagulation. At this point, a Frazier dissector could be passed superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally to the T11-T12 nerve roots bilaterally, and the thecal sac was noted to be decompressed both superiorly and inferiorly, and noted to be quite pulsatile. A #4 Penfield was then used to probe the floor of the spinal canal, and no significant ventral compression remained on the thecal sac. Copious antibiotic irrigation was used and at this point on the patient's right side, pedicle screws were placed at T11 and L1 using the technique described for a left-sided pedicle screw placement. The anatomic landmarks being the transverse process at T11, the inferior articulating facet, and the lateral aspect of the superior articular facet for T11 and at L1, the transverse process, the junction of the intra-articular process and the facet joint. With the screws placed on the left side, the elongated rod was removed from the patient's right side along with the locking caps, which had been placed. It was felt that distraction was not necessary. A 75-mm rod could be placed on the patient's left side with reattachment of the locking screw heads with the rod cap locker in place; however, it was necessary to cut a longer rod for the patient's right side with the screws slightly greater distance apart ultimately settling on a 90-mm rod. The locking caps were placed on the right side and after all 4 locking caps were placed, the locking cap screws were tied to the cold weld. Fluoroscopic examination demonstrated no evidence of asymmetry at the intervertebral space at T11-T12 or T12-L1 with excellent positioning of the rods and screws. A crosslink approximately 60 mm in width was then placed between the right and left rods, and all 4 screws were tightened. It should be noted that prior to the placement of the rods, the patient's autologous bone, which had been removed during laminectomy portion of the procedure and cleansed off soft tissue and morcellated was packed in the posterolateral space after decortication had been effected on the transverse processes at T11, T12, and L1 with AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment as well as the lateral aspects of the facet joints. This was done bilaterally prior to placement of the rods. Following placement of the rods as noted above, allograft bone chips were packed in addition on top of the patient's own allograft in these posterolateral gutters. Gelfoam was used to cover the thecal sac and at this point, the wound was closed by approximating the deep muscle with 0 Vicryl suture. The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular layer was closed with 2-0 inverted interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin approximated with staples. The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications.",TRUE
